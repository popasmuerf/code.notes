OTRS overview
=========================
Based on micro Service principles,
we need to have separate microservices
for each functonality that can function
independently.  Aftre looking at
the OTRS, we can easily divide the 
OTRS into three main services:

OTRS main services:
---------------------------
	*	Restaurant Service:
			*	This service provides
				the functonality for the
				Restaurant resource:
					*	Create
					*	Read
					*	Update
					*	Delete
				It provides the association
				between restaurants and tables
				Restaurants would also provide
				the access to the Table entity
	*	User Service:
			*	This service allows the end
				user to perform CRUD ops
				on user entities	
	*	Booking Service:
			*	This makes use of the Restaurant
				service and User service to
				perform CRUD operations
				on booking.  It would use
				the Restaurant searching, its
				associated tables lookup
				and allocatin base on table
				availability for a specified
				teim duration.  It creates
				the relationship between
				the Restaruant/Tabl and the User



Table Reservation Services
==================================

-------------------------
|	Service Registration |<---> RestaurantService
|		&                |<---> UserService
|	Discoverty           |<---> BookingService
-------------------------
	




Note: there could be other micro-services


Requrements:
===========================
	*	As a user I would like
		to add and retrieve
		restaurants

	*	As a user I wold like to 
		find restaurants baced on
		cuisine or on rating


Design
=========================
	*	Entity = restaurant
		(we assume that each
		restaurant is unique)
	*	Use Interface Segregation
		Principle:
			*	clients should
				not be forced
				to depend upon
				interfaces that they 
				do not use
