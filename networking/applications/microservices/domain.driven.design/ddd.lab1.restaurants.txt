Sample domain service
=========================
	*	DDD is based on domain,
		hence it is not recommended
		that we use a top-downapprach 
		where the UI would be
		develpeed first.
	*	We are creating a restaurant
		Service

Requrements:
===========================
	*	As a user I would like
		to add and retrieve
		restaurants

	*	As a user I wold like to 
		find restaurants baced on
		cuisine or on rating


Design
=========================
	*	Entity = restaurant
		(we assume that each
		restaurant is unique)
	*	Use Interface Segregation
		Principle:
			*	clients should
				not be forced
				to depend upon
				interfaces that they 
				do not use
