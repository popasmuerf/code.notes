Integrating Kafka and Spark Streaming:
Code Examples and State of the Game
==============================================
Spark Streaming has been getting some attention
lately as a real-time data processing tool, often
mentioned alongside with Apache Storm.

What is Kafka?
===============================================
Kafka is a distribted, partitioned, replicated
commit log service.  It provides the functionality
of a messaging system, but with the unique design.


Kafka(general messaging terminology)
===============================================
Kafka maintains feeds of messages in categories called topics
Processes that publish messages to Kafka are called topic producers
We'll call processes that subscribe to topics and process the feed of published messages
consumers
Kafka is run as a cluster comprised of one or more servers each of which is called a broker

producer----------------                                        -------------consumer

Communication between clients is peformed via TCP
1st and 3rd party Kafka clients are widely available

What is Storm ?
===============================================
Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed realime computation
system.  Storm makes it easy to reliably
process ubounded streams of data, doing 
for realtime process what Hadoop did for batch processing.
Storm is simple, can be used with ANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
Storm allows for the following:
	Supports All programming languages
	Scaling out
	Fault-tolerance
	ETL(Extract-Transform-Load):
		Extract:
			Get data from source system efficiently
		Transform:
			Perform calculations on data
		Load:
			Load the data in the target storage
		Clean:
			Perform data cleansng and dimension conforming
		Transform:
			Perform calculations on data
		Load:
			Load the data in the target storage
