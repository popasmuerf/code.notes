Uses of Reflection
===================================================
Reflection is commonlyused by programs which require
the ability to examine or modify the runtime behavior of
applications running in the Java machine.




Lesson:Classes
=======================================================
Every type is either a reference or a primitive:
	*	Classes (inherits from java.lang.Object)
	*	enums (inherits from java.lang.Object)
	*	arrays (inherits from java.lang.Object)
	*	interfaces
	*	boolean(primitive)
	*	byte(primitive)
	*	short(primitive)
	*	int(primitive)
	*	long(primitive)
	*	char(primitive)
	*	float(primitive)


java.lang.Class
====================================================
For every type of object the Java virtual machine instantiates
an immutable instance of :

	java.lang.Class

which provides methods to examine the runtim eproperties
of the object including its member and type 
information.

Class provides the ability to create new classes
and objects.  Most importantly, it is the entry point
for all of the Reflection APIs.  this lession covers
the most commonly used reflection operations involving 
classes:

	*	Retrieving Class Objects
	*	Examining Class Modifiers and Types
	*	Discovering Class Members
	*	Troubleshooting





Retrieving Class Objects
========================================
If an instance of an object is 
available, then the simplest way to 
get it's Class is to invoke:

	Object.getClass() 

Class c =  "foo".getClass() ; //returns Class for String

int varInt = 0 ;
Class c = varInt.getClass() ;//compile time error.  Primitives
							// in Java cannot be dereferenced..
							// all primitives in Java are passed
							// by value.


Class c = int.class; //this will work....




Class.forName()
==============================================
If the fully-qualified name of a calss is
available , it is possible to get the 
coressponding Classusing the static 
method:

	Class.forName()

This icannot be used for primitive types.

Class c = Class.forName("com.duke.localServicePovider")


TYPE Field for Primitive Type Wrappers
============================================
The .class syntax is more convenient and the preferred
way to obtain the Class for a primitive type;
however there is another way to acquire the 
Class.  Each of the primitive types and void has
a wraper class in 

	java.lang

that is used for boxing of primitive types
to reference types.  Each wrapper 
class contains a field name TYPE 
which is equal to the Class for the primitive
type being wrapped.


Class c = Double.TYPE ;
class d = Void.TYPE ;



Methods that Return Classes
==========================================
There ar several Refelction APIs which return
classes but these may only be accessed if
a Class has laready been obtained either directly
indirectly.

Class class = Classs.getSuperClass() 

//code 
public class ClassA extends PhoneticAbstr{
    String fieldStr ;
    int fieldInt ;
    double fieldDouble ;
    public ClassA(){
    }

    public class  ClassA0{
       public ClassA0(){
           
       }
    }
}


......
......

 Class<?>[] classLst = ClassA.class.getClasses() ;
        for( int j = 0; j < classLst.length; j++){
            System.out.println(classLst[j].toString());
            //System.out.println(j);
        }
        System.out.println(classLst.length);
......
......



There ar several refletion APIs which return clases
but these may only be accessed if a Class has
already been obtaine either directlry 
or indirectly:

Class<?> classes = Class.getlasses()



We can get listing of classes that exist in our class path:




Exampining Class Modifiers and Types
================================================
url: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/class/classModifiers.html

A class may be declared with one or more
modifiers  which affect its runtime behavior

	*	Access modifiers
		-public
		-protected
		-private
	*	Modifier rquiring override
		-abstract
	*	Modifier restricting to on instance 
		-static
	*	Modifier prohibiting valued modifiation 
		-final
	*	Modifier forcing strict floating point behaviro
		-stritfp


Not all modifieres are allowed on all classes, for example
an interface annot be final and an enum
cannot be abstract
	
		java.lang.reflect.Modifier

declrations for all modifiers.
