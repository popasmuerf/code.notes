Introduction
====================================================
Java Keytool is a key and certificate management tool that is used to
manipulate  Java Keystores and is included with Java.
A Java Keystore is a container for authorization certificates or public key
certificates, and is often used by Java-based applications for encryption, authentication,
and serving over HTTPS.  Its entries are protected by a keystore password.  A
keystore entry is identified by an alias, and it consists of keys and 
certificates that form a trust chain.
