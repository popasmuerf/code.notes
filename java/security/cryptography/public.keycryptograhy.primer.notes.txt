Public Key cryptography
==================================================



Symmetric cryptography
------------------------------------------------
*	John has a box with a lock
*	John has the key to that lock
*	Anyone with a copy of John's key can open the box



Asymmetric cryptography
------------------------------------------------
*	Anna has a box with a  special lock
*	The lock as 3 states:
	-	State-A : Locked
	-	State-B : Unlocked
	-	State-C	: Locked

*	Anna picks the first one of the keys and keeps it
	to herself.  This is Anna's private key

*	Anna picks a second key.  This is Anna's public key.
	Anna may make any numbeer of copies of it to pass
	out to her friends and family.

*	Anna's private key can turn the lock from states
	A, to B, to C.  

*	All the public keys can turn the lock from states
	C, to B, to A

*	If you want store something in Anna's box with a public
	key...then you turn the lock with your key until it
	reaches B, store whatever you like...and then turn it
	to A to lock it.  The public key cannot be used again
	to unlock....

*	Anna can unlock and retrive her item by
