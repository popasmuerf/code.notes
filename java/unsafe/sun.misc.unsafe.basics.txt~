Understanding sun.misc.Unsafe

=================================================
The biggest competitor to the Java virutal machine
might be Microsoft's CLR that hosts languages
such as C#.  The CLR allows to write unsafe
code as an entry gate forlow level programming,
something that is hard to achieve on teh JVM.  If you need
such advanced functionality in Java, there is the JNI,
which requires  you to know some C and will
quickly lead to code  that is tightly coupled to a specific
platform. With:

        sun.misc.Unsafe

there is however another alternative to low-level programming
on the Java p;ltaform using a Java API, even though this
altrenative is discouraged.  Nevertheless, several applications
rely on  sun.misc.Unsafe such for example:

        *       objenesis
        *       kryo(Twitter Storm)
        *       Grails
        *       etc
