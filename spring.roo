Getting started with spring boot
========================================
Spring Boot lets us rapidly create rock solid applications
As an example, look at the following surce code written in
Groovy in app.groovy:

@RestController
class App{
        @RequestMapping("/")
        def home(){
                "Hello,world!!!"
        }
}
