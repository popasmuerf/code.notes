Groovy Servlet support
http://groovy-lang.org/servlet.html
============================================================
We can write (Java) servlets in Groovy (called groovlets)

Thre is also a GroovyServlet

This feature will atuomatically compile your groovy source files, turn then into bytecode,
load the Class and cache it until you change the source file

Here is a simple example below to show the kind of things we  can do with
Groovelets.

Notice the use of implicit variables to access the session, output and request.
Also notice that this is more like a script as it does not have a class wrapper



if(!session){
    session = request.getSession(true)
}
if(!session.counter){
    session.counter = 1
}

println """
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Groovy Servlet</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>
                
            </p>
        </body>
    </html>
""" 
session.counter = session.counter + 1
