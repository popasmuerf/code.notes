The ability of programs at compile time
to get information internal to the compiler.


Java Reflection Basics

Java reflection makes it possible to inspect classes,
interface, fields and methods at runtime,
without knowning the names of the cleasss, methods, etc. at compile time.

It is also possible to instantiate new objects, invoke methods and
get/set field values using reflection.

Java reflection is very powerful and can be very useful:

	*	Mapping properties in JSON files

	*	Instantiating new objects

	*	Invoiking methods get/set field
		values using reflection
