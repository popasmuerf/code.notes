### Sentiment Analysis
-> Studies human emotions regarding opinions and intent present within data 
	--> negtive
	--> neutral
	--> positive 


### Threat Hunting 
	-> Hypothesis:
		--> hunches based on clues
	-> People :
		--> Threat Actors
		--> Vectors
		--> Intelligence Sources 

	-> Assumptive:
		--> assumes that the worse has already happened
			---> Breaches have already happened
			---> There are bad actors in the org internally who have already breached security policy 

	-> Iterative:
		--> much like a pen tester a threat hunter must pivot frequently in order to 
		continue lateral movelment while seeking further evidence

	-> ulimtate goal 
		--> disrupt attackers during any fphase of the cyber kill chain
		--> cyber kill chains are a poart of the Incident Response.

	-> SEIM is an important part of threat hunting



	-> This brining together of internal and external threat feeds is known as 
	"intelligence fusion".  and it enablees an organization to establish a more accurate threat 
	profile.  Interanl and external sources are defined as follos

		--> Internal threat data:
			---> Internal logs 
				----> SEIM
				----> raw log sources 
			---> previous knowledtge of prior attacks
			---> previous indicators of comprimise
			---> info on attacker 
			---> packet captures
			---> Baseline data on networktrafic also makes it possible to understand
			what's expected and aid in indentifying anaomalies
		--> External threat data:
			---> threate data consists of structurdthreat information such as STIX
			----> Unstructured data :
				-----> security advisories
				-----> bulletins 
				-----> OSINT(forums, blogs,documents ,etc are unstructured....OSINT APIs are semi-structured)

		--> Fusion analysis can aid in processing data and yielding more meaningful insights to provide a
		comphrehensive look at the threats to an organization.
