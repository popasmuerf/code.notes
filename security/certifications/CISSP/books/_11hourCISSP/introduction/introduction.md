## Introduction

-   The common thread is risk, which is
    part of all Cyber-Security job descriptions

-   The Security and Risk Management domain
    focuses on risk analysis and mitigation.

## Cornerstone Information Security Concepts

Before we can explain access control, we 
must define cornerstone information security concepts.
These concepts provide the foundation upon which the
eight domains of the Common Body of
knowledge are built


Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are
referred to as the CIA triad, which the cornerstone
concept of information security. 

#### Confidntiality
    -   Seeks to prevent unauthorized disclosure
    -   Keeps data secret
    -   Theft of PII is an example of lack of confidentiality
#### Integrity
    -   Seeks to prevent unauthorized modification of data
    -   In other works, integrity seeks to prevent unauthorized
        write access to data or system configuration
    -   There are two types of **Integrity** within his context
        -   System Integrity 
        -   Data Integrity
#### Availability
    -   Ensures that data is available when needed.
    -   Systems need to be usable(available) for normal business
    -   An example of attacke on avaliability would be a denial
        of service DoS attack or a zero day exploit that encrypts the data of a system thereby making he 
        system completely useless

## Disclosure, alteration, and destruction (DAD)
...is an alternate description of the CIA triad

#### Disclosure
    -   Unauthorized release of information
#### Alteration
    -   Unauthorized modification of data
#### Destruction
    -   Destruction of data...data that is unrecoverable is 
        essentially destroyed
        Systems that are DDosed into oblivion are essentally
        within that period of time "destroyed


The CIA triad, which the cornerstone concept of information security...the three legged stool upon which security
is built.  The order of the acronym  may change to avoid
association with a certain intelligence agency. 

## Identity and Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability 

The term AAA is often used to described the 
cornerstone concepts of authentication, authorization,
and accountability.  Left out of the *AAA* is **indentifcation**
before the 3 AAAs can be achieved

#### Identity and authentication
Identity is a claim:
    If your name is "Foo" then
    you identify yourself via asserting that
    your name is "Foo"

  - Proving an identity claim is called **authentication**
  - You authenticate a claim to identity via supplying          addtional information that reasonably lends to weight to your claim of identity
  - Additional data that reasonably proves your claim of identityare
    - passwords
    - Security questions(whom's answers essentally  are also passwords)
    - unique 


#### Authorization
Authorization describes the actions ou can perform
on a system once you have been identified and authenticated.
Actions may include reading, writing,
or executing files or programs

#### Accountability
Acoountability holds users accountable for their actions.
This is typically done by logging and analysing  log data
Enforcing accountability helps keep honest people honest.
For some users...knowing that data is logged is not enough to provide accountability; they must know that data is logged and audited, and
that sanctions may result from violation of policy.
