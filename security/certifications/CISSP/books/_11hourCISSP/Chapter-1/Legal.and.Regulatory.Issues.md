## Legal and Regulatory Issues
Though general understanding of major legal systems
and types of law is important, it is critical that
information security professionals understand the
concepts described in the next section.  With the
ubiquity of information systems, data, and applications
comes a host of legal issues that require attention.

## compliance with Laws and Regulations
Complying with laws and regulations is a priority
for top information security management, bot in the
real world and the CISSP exam.  An organization must be
in compliance with all laws and regulations that 
apply to it.  Ignorance of the law is never a valid excuse for breaking the.


## Major Legal Systems
In order to begin to appreciate common legal concepts
at awork in today's global economy,an understanding of the major legal systems is required.  These legal systems
provide the framework that determines how a country develops laws pertaining to information systems in the first place.  The three major systems of law are
-   civil
-   common
-   religious


### Common Law
-   is a legal system used in 
    -   United Kingdom
    -   Canada
    -   United states
    -   Many former British colonies
    -   Emphasis on particular cases, judicial precedents as determinates of extant law
    -   Legislatures write laws, however it is judicial rulings that can at times supersede those laws.  Because of the empahsis on jude's interpretations, there is significant possiblity that a society changes over time, so can judicial interpreations.

### Criminal, Civil, and Adminstrative Laws 
Within common law there are various branches of laws, including criminal, civil, and adminsistrative law.

    -   Criminal law
        -   Criminal law pertains to those laws where the victim can be seen as society itself.
        -   Criminal law includes penalties that remove an individual from society by incarceration or via death.
        -   The goal of criminal law is to determine crime
        -   Burden of proof lies with the prosecution and must be beyond a reasonable doubt do to the severity of criminal sentences

    -   Civil law
        -   Is a subset of common law
        -   **Tort** law a synonym for Civil law
        -   Tort law dals with injury(loosely defined) resulting from somone violating their responsibility to provide a duty of care.
        -   **Tort** is a primary component of Civil law and is the most significant source of lawsuits that seek damages
        -   The burden of proof in Tort/Civil proceedings is the preponderance of the evidence.
        -   **Preponderance** means more likely than not.

### Religious Customary Law
-   Relgious doctrine or interpretation serves as the primary source of legal understanding and statues.
-   While Christianity, Judaism, and Hindusim have all had significant influence on national legal systms, Islam serves as the most common source for religious legal systems currently.
    -   Sharia
    -   Hadith
    -   Qur'an

-   Customary law referes to thsoe customs or practices that are so commonly accepted by a group that the custom is treated as laws
-   Customary practices can be later codified as laws in the more traditional sense, bu the empahsis on the prvailing acceptance of a group is quite important


| Financial Damages | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Statutory         | Statutory damages are those prescribed by law, which can be awarded to the victim even  if the victim incurred no actual loss of  injury                                                                                                                                 |
| Compensatory      | The purpose of compensatory damages is to provide the victim  with financial award in effort to compensate for the loss or injury incurred as a direct result of the wrongdoing                                                                                          |
| Punitive          | The intent of punitive damages is to punish is to punish an individual or organization. These damages are typically awarded to  attempt to discourage a particularly egregious violation where the compensatory or  statutory damages alone would not act as a deterrent |



## Adminstrative law

Adminstrative law or regulatory law is law enacted by
government agencies.  The executive branch enacts
adminstratrive law in the United States.  Government-mandated compliance measures are 
administrtive laws.
    -   FCC Regulations
    -   HIPPA(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) mandates
    -   FDA egulations
    -   FAS regulations


## Liability
Legal liability is another important legal concept
for information security professionals and their 
employers.  Organizations are legally liable for specfic
actions or inactions and can prove most costly.  Liability can be avoided via **Due Care and Due Diligence**

    -   Due care is doing what is reasonable in a given context
    -   Due care is often called the "Prudent Man Rule"
    -   The term is derived from "duty of care" 
    -   Due diligence is the management of due care
    -   Due care and due diligence are often confused as they are related
    -   Due care is informal while diligence follows actual codified policy and process.
    -   Due diligence is a step beyond Due care

## Gross negligence
Gross negligence is the opposite of due care and important legal concept.

For example, if you suffer loss of PII, but can demonstrate due care i nprotecting the PII, you are on 
stronger legal ground in a proceeding.  If you cannot 
demonstrate due care(acting in gross negligence) you are in much worse legal position.  This is why we have security audits


## Legal Aspects of Investigations

Investigations are a critical way in which information  security professionals come into contact with the law.  Forsensic and incident response personnel often conduct investigations, therefore both need to have a basic understanding of legal matters to ensure that the legal merits of investigation are not unintentionally tarnished.

### Evidence
    - One of the most important legal concepts
    - Security Professionals will commonly be involved in
      in investigations, and they will often have to 
      obtain or handle evidence during the investigation

    - Real evidence consists of tangible or physical 
      objects.
    - Circumstantial evidence serves to establish the 
      circumstances related to a particular point or
      other evidence
    - Cooborative evidence provides additional support for a fact that might have been called into question.
    - Hearsay evidence constitutes second-hand or anectdotal evidence...as opposed to direct evidence
    - Secondary evidence is often copies of authoritative documents, data, and oral descriptions
    - System logs and documents might also constitute 
      secondary rather than best/direct evidence 
    - Courts prefer the best evidence possible. Original 
      documents arepreferred over copies, and conclusive, tangible objects are preferred over oral testimony.


### Evidence integrity

    -   Evidence must reliable and authoritative
    -   Checksums can ensure that no data changes
        have occured as a result of the acquisition
        and analysis.
        -   One way hash functions are useful here
            -   MD5
            -   SHA-1

    -   Chain of custody requires that once evidence
        has been acquired, full documentation 
        must be maintained regarding who or what the 
        handled the evidence and when and where it was handled

### Entrapment and enticement

    -   Entrapment is when law enforcement persuades
        someone to commit a crime when the person otherwise had no intention to cimmit a crime.
        Enticement could still involve agents of law enforcement making the conditions for commion of a crime favorable, but the diference is that the
        preson is determined to have already broken a law or is intent on doing so.

### Computer Crime

    -   Applicable computer crime laws vary throughout the world, according to jurisdiction.  However, regardless of region, some generalities exist.

    -   Computer crimes can be based upon the way in which computer systems relate to the wrongdoing.  For example, computer systems can be used as targets they can be used as the tools used in perpetrating the crime
