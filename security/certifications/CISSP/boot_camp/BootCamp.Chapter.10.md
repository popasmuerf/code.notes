    -   Marking Sensistive Data Assets
        -   Physcial and logical labling
    -   Handling Sensitive Information and Assets
        -   Secure transportation of media
    -   Data Collection Limitation
        -   If you don't need it, don't collect it
        -   Delete any unneeded data
    -   Data Location
        -   Where is data stored ?
        -   Primary data and backups
        -   Offsite is essential for backups
        -   How far is far enough
        -   Data center replication
    -   Storing Sensitive Data
        -   Use encyrption
        -   use physical security
    -   Data Destruction
        -   NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1, "Guidelines for Media Sanitazation"
        -   Data remanence
        -   HDD vs SSD/Flash
        -   Common DAta Destruction Methods
            -   Erasing, Clearing, Purging
            -   Degaussing, Destruction

        -   Declassification
        -   Cryptographic Erasure 
            -   Destroy key(s)
    -   Ensuring Appropriate Data and Asset Retention
        -   Record retention
        -   Media, system retention
        -   A necessary eleement of a security policy
        -   Need to address:
            -   End of life(EOL)
            -   Endo of support (EOS)
            -   Endo of service life(EOSL)
    -   Digital Rights Management(DRM)

        -   Con

    -   CASB (Cloud access security broker)
        -   Scan data at rest and apply data access policies 
        -   Idenity
        -   Mobile

    Pseudonymizaton, Tokenization, and Anonymization
        -   Pseudonym or alias
            -   Artifical identifiers
            -   Often similar in structure to original data
        -   Tokenization
