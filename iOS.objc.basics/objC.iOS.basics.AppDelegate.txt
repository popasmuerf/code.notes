Datatypes/Classes/Objects most often used in ObjC programming
============================

NSString:
	String type
CGFloat:
	Floating point type; float is also available for use, but 
	CGFloat is apparently better.
NSInteger:
	Integer types
NSLog:
	Analogous to System.out.println()
BOOL:
	Analogous to boolean or bool
NSArray:
	immutable array
NSMutableArray:
	mutable array




iOS project framework
============================
Important files auto-generated:
	AppDelegate.h
	AppDelegate.m
	ViewController.h
	ViewController.m
	ViewContraller.xib

What do they do ?:
	*AppDelegate :
		The AppDelegate just sits there waiting
		to be told that something potentioally important has or will happen.
		AppDelegate is the proxy between you and iOS/your app:
			*The app will create one instance of that class(singleton)
			*The app will send messages to the AppDelegate singleton
			such that the AppDelegate will influence the app's behavior
			at well-defined times.
			*Example:
				-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
				^^is sent  when the app has finished launching and is ready
				to do something interesting.
			*It contains your app's startup code
			*It responds to key changes in the state of your app.  Specifically, it responds to both temporary
			interruptions and to changes in the execution state of your app, such as when your app transistions
			from the foreground to the background
			*It responds to notifications originiating from outside the app, such as remote notifications
			(also known as push notifications), low-memory warnings, download completion notificatond, and more
			*It determines whether state preservation and restortion shold occur and assists in the preservation
			and restoration process as needed.
			*It responds to events that target the app iselt and are not specific to yoru app's views or view
			controllers
			*You can use it to store your app's central data opbjects or any content that does not have an owning view
			controller
			*Reference for this is in the UIApplicationDelegate reference page:
				https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/index.html
	*ViewController:
		Class that defines a view controller class.
		Manages hierarchy of views -- basically, one screen of an application.
		You may have multiple screens that each have a their own view controller.
