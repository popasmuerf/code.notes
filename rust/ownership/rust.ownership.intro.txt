Rust and Ownership
===========================
let x = 5;
let y = x;


Multiple variables can interact with the same
data in different ways in Rust.

We can probably guess what this is doing based on our
experience with other languages: "Bind the
value 5 to x ; then make a copy of the value
in x and bind it to y."  We now have tow
varaibles, x and y, and both equal 5.  this is
indeed what is happening because integers
are simple values with a known,
fixed size, and these two 5 values are pushed onto 
the stack.



Now let's look at the string version:

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1

this looks very similar to the previous code,
so we might assume that the way if towrks would be th 
same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in 
s1 and bind to s2, but that isn't 
what quite happens:

A "String" is made up of three parts:
	1. a ptr on the stack pointing to the
	first element in of the String...which
	is really just an array of chars
	2. The actual String is stored on the 
	heap

This could be a problem, whens2 and s1 go out
of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory.   This is known as a double free
error and is on of the memory safety bugs that
Rust tries to do away with.  Freeing memory twice
may lead to memory corruptions, which can lead
to security vulnerabilities.


To ensure memory safety, there's one more detail to
what happens in this situation in Rust.  Instead
of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust considers
s1 to no longer be valid and therefore, Rust
doesn't need to free anything when s1 goes out of 
scope.  checkout what happens when we attempt this 
and try to compile...

let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = s1

println!("{}, world!", s1);

///code 

fn main() {
   let s1 = String::from("hello");
   let s2 = s1;
   println!("{} world!!", s1)
}

 If you’ve heard the terms “shallow copy” and “deep copy” while working with other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity without copying the data probably sounds like a shallow copy. But because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of calling this a shallow copy, it’s known as a move. Here we would read this by saying that s1 was moved into s2. So what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.



So variable s1 goes out of scope somehow....and we try to use
variable s2...then the compiler will hammer us for it...




Stack-Only Data:Copy
=============================================
There's another wrinkle we haven't talked
about yet.  this is shown below:


let x = 5 ;
let y = x ; 

println!("x = {}, y = {} ",x,y);

^^^Does this code seem to contradict what we just
learned ?   we don't  have to call to
clone() but x is valid and wasn't moved into y


The reason is that types like lintegers
that have a known size at compile time
are stored entirely in th stack, so 
copies of the actual values are quikck
to make.  That means there's no
reason we want to prevent x from being valid 
after we create the variable y.  In other
words 
there is a dffierence
between deep and shallow copying and we can
leave it out.


Rust has a special annotation called the 
"Copy" trait that we can place on
types like integers that are stored
on the stack

If a type has the "Trait", an older
variable is still usable after assignment.

Rust wont let us annotate a type with the 
"Copy" trait if the type, or any of
its parts, has implemented the
"Drop" trait.

So...if we are going to get into
the deep of it all with respect to ownership
of types....then we need to dive into
the documentation:

	*	All the integer types, like u32
	*	The Boolean type, bool, with values ture, and false
	*	The characer type, char
	*	All the floating point types, like f64
	*	Tuples, but only if they contain types that are also
		"Copy". (i32, i32) is "Copy", but
		(i32,String) is not


/**
	The heap is where we perform 
	dynamic computing w/r to allocation
	of new memory.  This type of computing 
	will always be slower than computing
	off the stack because the stack
	will always be O(n=1).  Java(at least
	initially)
**/


Owndership and Functions
================================================
the semantics for passing a value to a 
function are similar to assigning a value to

Passing a varaible to a function will move or copy
just like assignment. 
a variable to a function will move or
copy, just like assgnment.  Below is 
an example with some annotations showing where variables go into
and out of scope

//code --> src/main.rs


fn main(){
	let s = String::from("hello"); //s comes into scope
	takes_ownership(s);
	let x = 5 ;
 	makes_copy(x);
}



fn takes_ownershp(some_string:String){
	println!("{}", some_string);
	//Here some_string goes out of  scoope
	//and `drop` is called.  The backing
	//memory is freed
}


fn makes_copy(some_integer:i32){
	println!("{}", some_integer)
	//Here, some_integer goes out of
	//scope.  Nothing special
	//happens
}



Returning Values and Scope
=================================================

Returning values can also transfer ownership
// src/main.rs

fn main(){
	let s = String::from("hello"); //s comes into scope
	takes_ownership(s);
	let x = 5 ;
 	makes_copy(x);
}


fn gives_ownership() -> String{
	let s1 = gives_ownership() ;
	let s2 = String::from("hello");
	let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2);
}

fn takes_ownership(some_string:String){
	println!("{}", some_string);
	//Here some_string goes out of  scoope
	//and `drop` is called.  The backing
	//memory is freed
}


fn makes_copy(some_integer:i32){
	println!("{}", some_integer)
	//Here, some_integer goes out of
	//scope.  Nothing special
	//happens
}

fn gives_ownersip -> String{
	let some_string = String::from("hello");
	some_string
}

fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string:String)->String{
	a_string
}



Taking ownership and then returning ownsership
with every function is a bit tdious.  What if 
we want to let a function use a value but not take ownersip?
It's quite annoying that anything we
pass in also needs to be passed back 
if we want to use it again, in addtion to any data resulting
from teh body of the function that we might want
to return as well.

// src/main.rs

fn main(){
	let s1 = String::from("hello");
	let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);
	println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s2, len)l
}


fn calculate_length(s:String) -> (String, usize){
	let length = s.len();
	(s, length)
}
