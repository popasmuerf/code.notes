Rust and Ownership
===========================
let x = 5;
let y = x;


Multiple variables can interact with the same
data in different ways in Rust.

We can probably guess what this is doing based on our
experience with other languages: "Bind the
value 5 to x ; then make a copy of the value
in x and bind it to y."  We now have tow
varaibles, x and y, and both equal 5.  this is
indeed what is happening because integers
are simple values with a known,
fixed size, and these two 5 values are pushed onto 
the stack.



Now let's look at the string version:

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1

this looks very similar to the previous code,
so we might assume that the way if towrks would be th 
same: that is, the second line would make a copy of the value in 
s1 and bind to s2, but that isn't 
what quite happens:

A "String" is made up of three parts:
	1. a ptr on the stack pointing to the
	first element in of the String...which
	is really just an array of chars
	2. The actual String is stored on the 
	heap

This could be a problem, whens2 and s1 go out
of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory.   This is known as a double free
error and is on of the memory safety bugs that
Rust tries to do away with.  Freeing memory twice
may lead to memory corruptions, which can lead
to security vulnerabilities.


To ensure memory safety, there's one more detail to
what happens in this situation in Rust.  Instead
of trying to copy the allocated memory, Rust considers
s1 to no longer be valid and therefore, Rust
doesn't need to free anything when s1 goes out of 
scope.  checkout what happens when we attempt this 
and try to compile...

let s1 = String::from("Hello");
let s2 = s1

println!("{}, world!", s1);



So variable s1 goes out of scope somehow....and we try to use
variable s2...then the compiler will hammer us for it...
