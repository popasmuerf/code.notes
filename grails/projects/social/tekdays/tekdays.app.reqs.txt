Description
===================================
TekDays.com is going to be a site where peiple can announce, plan, and promote
local, grassroots technical conferences.  It will all stat when visionary individuals
suggest an event in their city.  Then, as others hear about it and register their
interest and/or support, we'll provide tools to help them organize the event: a to-do list,
an organizer's dashborad(to keep track of volunterrs, sponsrs, andpotential attendees),
a discussion forum, and,  fianlly, an event home page to help with promotion.  This may
sound like a tall order, but Grails can make it happen.
