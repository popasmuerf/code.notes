The Web Layer rundown

====================================================================

Controllers

====================================================================
Controllers handles requests and creates or prepares responses.
A controller can generate the response directlly or delegate to a view.
The default url maping configuration ensures that the first part of 
your contrller name is mapped to a to a URI and each action defined within
your controller maps to URIs within the controller name URI.

cmd
------------------------------------------------------------------------
> grails create-controller
    -or-
> grails gernerate-controller

Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------
> grails create-controller com.lab.book

/**resultant code **/
package com.demo

class BookController {

    def index() { }
    def
}

Controller actions

====================================================================
A controller can have as many multiple public action methods;
each one maps to a URI

cmd
------------------------------------------------------------------------
> grails create-controller
    -or-
> grails gernerate-controller

Example
------------------------------------------------------------------------
> grails create-controller com.lab.book

/**resultant code **/
package com.demo

class BookController {

    def index() { }
    def list(){
        //do controller logic
        //create model
        return model
    }
}


Note: Leveraging Public Methods as Actions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In earlier versions of GRAILS actions were implemented with
Closures.  This is still supported, but the preferred approach
is to use methods.

Levering methods instead of Closures properties has some
advantages:

    *   Efficient use of Memory
    *   Allow use of stateless controllers(singleton scope)
    *   Actions may be overrided in derivative classes
    *   Methods can be intercepted with standard proxying methods...
        which is possible with closures...but it isn't easy

Note: All contorllers in grails have a default action
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
A controller has the concept of a default URI that maps to the root
URI of the controller, for example:

    /book ---->  BookController
    
These are the rules:
    *   if there is only one action, it's the default
    *   if you have an action named index, it's the default
    *   Alternatively, you can set it explicity within the 
        controller using the inherited property:
        
        static defaultAction = "list"
        

Controllers and Scopes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The available scopes are:

    *   serveletContext
    *   flash
    *   appContext
    *   request
    *   session
    *   params
    *   flash

Accessing Scopes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Scopes can be accessed using the variable names above in
combination with Groovy's array index operator, even on
classes provided by the servlet API such as HttpServletRequest


/*********example code*********/

class BookController{

    def find(){
        def findBy = params["findBy"]
        def appContext = request["foo"]
        def loggedUser = session["logged_user"]
    }
}
/************---OR-----************/
class BookController{

    def find(){
        def findBy = params["findBy"]
        def appContext = request["foo"]
        def loggedUser = session["logged_user"]
    }
}

Using the Flash Scope
----------------------------------------------------------------------
    *   is often rferred to as a scope.  It's more accurate to rfere to it as a 
    Map that exits in a speical scope.  Vaues stored in flash are avaible
    for this reueat an one follwoin request, which allows us to store a message
    before redireing and have that message be availeble to the redirecte view. 
    
    /****************Example Use of the flash scope in a controller*************/
    
    class BookController{

    def findBookAuthor(){
       def book = Book.findByAuthor("David Setlzer")
       if
       if(!book){
            flash.messge = "....sorry...we could not find this author..."
            redirect(action:error)
       }
    }
}

Scoped Controllers
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Supported controller scopes are: 
    *   prototype(default) -- A new contorller is created for each request
    *   session -- One controller is created for the scope of the user session
    *   singleton   -- Only one instance of the controller ever exists(recommened for actions as methods)
    
/**Example of specifying scope of controller in your controller's code**/

class BookController{
    static scope = "session"
    def findBookAuthor(){
       def book = Book.findByAuthor("David Setlzer")
       if
       if(!book){
            flash.messge = "....sorry...we could not find this author..."
            redirect(action:error)
       }
    }
}




Setting the scope of controllers for the app globally
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a file in our app named:

    *   Config.groovy
    
We can set the global scope config for all controlers via editing the 
field within Config.groovy to:

    grails.contorllers.defaultScope = "singleton"
