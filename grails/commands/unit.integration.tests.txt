Integration Testing
=====================================



Integration Testing  Commands
======================================
An integration test is a Spock specification
or JUnit test case, just like a Grails unit
test.  The difference is in what is available to
the test runtime.  Unit tests are meant to test a unit(class)
in isolation...which does not test dynamic code during
runtime.

Integreation tests are meant to test multiple classes working together.  When running integration tests, Grails
adds all of the dynamic behavior that we like to take
advantage of in Grails.

For example...in TekDays.....the process of adding
default tasks to an event involves the instantiation of
the following classes:
--------------------------------------------------------
        TaskService
        Task
        TekEvent
--------------------------
> grails create-integration-test com.tekdays.TaskService
> grails test-app unit: TekEvent
