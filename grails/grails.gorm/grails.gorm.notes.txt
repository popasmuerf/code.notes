Large object Types
======================================================
Large objects are generally binary large objects(BLOBs)
and character large objects(CLOBS):

	*	Binary Large Objects(BLOBs)
	*	Character Large Objects(CLOBs)

Although we generally  are storing objects to the database...you don't
nreally want to use a database to store files.  Files can be large,
and unless you need to version those files, it is unwise to waste
the database as a stroage place.  Instead, use the file system
to keep files.  Remember that the point of a file system is to
store files.

Of course, there are legitimate reasons to store files in the dtabase, so if you want to
store BLOBs, simply set the datatype to:

	byte[]





Createing Relationships 
====================================================================
Unless you're building a domain structure with only a few classes,
you're bound to have relations to other classes.

	*	One-to-One
	*	One-to-Many
	*	Many-to-one
	*	Many-to-many


Writing relationships in Grails is relatively easy.  In fact, the syntax and usage are 
virtually identical to Ruby on Rail's ActiveRecrod.  Knowing that GORM is based on Hibernate,
you might expect the syntax and usage to be more like Hibernate or JPA, but this in't the 
case,  With standard JPA, yoiu can create relationhips using annotations
soley on one side of the bean.  However, these annotations can get complex:

//JPA relationshipt annotation examples:

@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(name="COURSE_TO_STUDNET_TBL",
		   joinColumns(name="courseId"),
		   inverseJoinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="studentId"))
private Collection<Student> students ;

^^^Note the that there are differnet annotations for each type of relationship.
In reality, JPA configures more from the database level, whereas GORM is programmed
more from the verbal level.  First, we'll review the players involved, an
then we'll show you how to create relationships


One-to-One
====================================
A one to one exists when mappings between records in two different tables
is unique.


//----Example One to One GORM ----//

class User{
	...
	Address address
}
class Address{
	User user
}

^^^Pretty simple...right ?  All we need to do is just embedd types...



One-to-Many
====================================
A one to one exists when mappings between records in two different tables
is unique.


//----Example One to One GORM ----//

class User{
	...
	static hasMany = [buddyLists:BuddyList]
}
class BuddyList{
	....
	static belongsTo = User
	static hastMany = [members:BuddyListMembers]
}


^^^Pretty simple...right ?  All we need to do is just embeded types...




Managing relationships
========================================================
BuddyList myList
myList.addToMembers(someMember)
myList.removeFromMembers(someMember)


Many-to-One
==========================================================
As you've probably guessed, a many-to-one relationship is the inverse
of the one-to-many relatioship.  Grails GORM one to many relationship
is enough here....as it serves the desired result.  In JPA there is 
actually a @ManyToOne annotation....wow.....


Many-to-Many
==================================================================
The many-to-many relationship further demonstrates the distinction between the
way GORM an dJPA implement relationships.  In a many to many relationship, 
a record in table A can reference multiple records in table B and vice versa
At least one of these classes needs to "belong" to the other(doesn't matter which one)
and both must include each other respectively in a "hasMany" statement.


class Todo{
	
	static hasMany = [keywords:Keyword]
}

class Keyword{
	static belongsTo = Todo
	static hasmany = [todos:Todo]
}
