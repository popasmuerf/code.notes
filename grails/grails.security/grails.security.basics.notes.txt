Grails security
=========================================================================
Grails security is application level security

Security models can get fairly convoluted depending on your application's needs.


Your average application security apparatus
=====================================================================
    *   Domain/model-level security
    *   Administrator vs. regular user access
    *   Basic access authentication

Basic authentication
=====================================================================
    *   login creds sent to the server typically correspond with entries in a
        database.  Of course, we will not be storing passowrds in the DB in clear
        text.
    *   Hashing(cryptography) is one way, as opposed to encryption which is two way.
    *   MD5 and SHA are common Hashing algorithms
    *   We can use org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils as this lib has many
        methods to produce different types of hashes

org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils
=============================================================================
For hashing in java...this is a common class used...

    *   DigestUtils.md5(java.lang.String data): 16-element byte[]
    *   DigestUtils..md5Hex(java.lang.String data): 32-character hext string
    *   DigestUtils.shaHex(java.lang.String data): 32-character hex string using SHA-1 digest
        mechanism

Consider this analogy:  Imagine a company where employees
are assigned tasks of different nature there
is an employee named John Doe with the following responsibilities:

    *   Handle accounting and releasing of check payments
    *   Take calls from customers for product support
    *   Handle administrative tasks such as a booking
        flights plus accomodation of executives
    *   Manage the schedule of the CEO
    
    
As you might have guessed, John's work is too complicated because he
needs to multi-task on very different tasks, and must context switch
for each task.  His herrors could cost a lot of money in the 
long run.

Likewise in software engineering it is not a good idea to write a cloass
that has different nature of responsibilities or behaviors.  The genearl
consensus of experst is that a single class or source file should only 
be invloved in one one nature of task(This is actually the Tao of Unix...each
component should should be self-contained....have low, next to no dependence
on anything but input, and do one thing and one thing well)

Adding needless complexity to a class, or module.....will only introduce bugs and
problems later in the application and it will be a pain to maintain(if it 


This is called the "seperation of concerns".

Conscider the following
------------------------
Inside a controller we can do the following:
--------------------------------------------
    *   Handle routing logic
    *   Invoke GORM operations to manipulate data in the database
    *   Render text and show it to the user

We can do just about anything in a controller...but we really shouldn't.

This is what we should be doing in a controller
-----------------------------------------------
    *   Recieve Requests from users
    *   Invoke the most appropiate business logic
    *   Invoke the view to display results
    
View logic should be taken care of inside Groovy Server pages(GSP)
files....for biz logic, they should be implemented inside the
service layer.  Grails has a default support and handling for 
the service layer.


Don't repeate yourself (DRY) Principle
===============================================================
We can reuse logic contained in a service layer object any and every
where in our app....because it is in a centralized place...as opposed
to being incapsulated individually in other specialized classes...
theoretcially we could use a have commonly used code in a specialized
class...and use it all over the place...but that would be very POOR design.

Create a service class
================================================================
>grails create-service 

package com.demo

class TestService{
    def serviceMethod(){
    }
}


Now, let's add as many funciton as needed that pertains to business logc and GORM operations.
=============================================================================================

package com.demo

class StudentService{

    Student createStudent(String lastName, String firstName){
        Student student = new Student(lastName, firstName)
        student.save()
        return student
    }
    private String genRefNumber(){
        import java.util.Random
        Random random = new Random()
        int numBound = 100000000
        int alphaBound = 0
        def extRefNumLst = []
        def alphalst = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","j","k"]
        alphaBound = random.nextInt(10)
        int refAlphaBound = random.nextInt(alphalst.size)
        int refNum = random.nextInt(numBound )
        String refAlpha = alphalst[refAlphaBound]
        while(extRefNumLst.contains(refNum)){
            refNum = random.nextInt(numBound)
        }
        return refNum.toString()
    }
}



Injecting a Service
=============================================================================================
The service is automatically injected inside a controller by just defining
a variable with the proper name.


package comd.demo

class DemoController{
    def studentService  //we inject services in GRAILS merely by declaring them
                        //inside our controller
                        
    displayForm(){....}
    def handleFormSubmit(){
        def student = studentSevice.createStudent(params.lastName,params.firstName)
        return [student:student]  //return this model map to be used in our gsp view...
    }
}

What if we want to inject other services into a particular service ?
==========================================================================
Then...we simply inject into a service class just like we inject a servcie into
a controller class....


What if we want to inject spring benas into the service  ?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!--injection code into spring\resources-->
<bean id="customBean" class="com.CustomBeanImpl"/>

Note  about the grails global object: params...
=======================================================================================
The variables used in our gsp/jsp forms in Grails may be accessed
anywhere in our app via the "params" object



Because of seperation of concerns....we can inject this Service in any other
Controller we like.....This is a feature of the Spring framework...which by the 
way GRAILS is based on.....All of this is Spring and JEE specfication compliant.
#WORD


More examples....of service injections...When I mentioned before that we can inject
services ANYWHERE....I meant ANYWHERE....even in other services...we can chain
service dependencies....within other services...
==============================================================================================
package com.demo

class PersonService{
    Person person = new Person(String lastName, String firstName){
        Person p = new Person()
        p.lastName = lastName
        p.firstName = firstName
        p.save()
        return p
    }
}


class EmployeeService{
    def personService //employees are people...after all...and we get to re-used code...
    Employee createEmployee(String lastName, String firstName){
        if(Student.count() == 0){
            studentService.createStudent("Doe","John)
            studentService.createStudent("Smith", "Jame")
        }
    }
}



We can also inject Servcies within BootStrap.groovy
===============================================================




Initilizing a Service....
==========================================================================
Spring and EJB don't always rely on constructors for intialization.  The main
reason dor this is because often a constructor might rely on items that need to 
be injected(like spring services), but these items may not be available
during instantiation.  If you have any items that need to be looked up
at creation, use Spring's InitializingBean, which calls the 
method:

    afterPropertiesSet()

//----Example code our sevice implements IntializingBean----//

import org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean

class TodoService implements InitializingBean{
    boolean transactional = true
    void afterPropertiesSet(){
        println "post Initialization"
    }
    def serviceMethod(){
        println "TodoService"
    }
}


Available Contexts for Sevices
===============================================================================
Service contexts have around for a while.  For a long time, 
We need application contexts....for certain contexts we find ourselves
within our application...which includes service contexts....for example...
    *   A conversation context is more than a request and less than a session....
        ..the data has a beginning...start...and end.
    *   A credit card application, which can take multple pages to complete...
        it contains data that you will want to have until the end.......

By default every context is a singleton, meaning that the whole application
shares this one instance.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This means that you don't want to have any data as a global property
with its state specific to the user.  To adjuste the context of a service, add
the following line to your service:

    static scope = "singleton


List of service contexts ....likely not exhasutive.....
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
*   prototype : A new service is instantiated for each service injected into a class
*   request  :  a new servcie is spawned for each servcie request using the service
*   flash   : The service is instantiated for the curren and next request only
*   flow   : The servcie lives for the lifetime of a controller's web flow
*   conversation : The service lives for the lifetime of a controller's web blow and subflows
*   session : The service is instantiated and kept for the life of the user's HttpSession
*   singleton : This default service is treated like a singleton and shared across the
                application scope
