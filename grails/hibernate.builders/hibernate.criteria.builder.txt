Builders 

Hibernate Criteria Builder
=============================================================
The Hibernate Criteria Builder allows you to create quieries that ap to
the Hibernate Criteria API.  There are equivalent builder  builder nodes
for most criterion within the Hiberante Expression class.  For more info
see the Builders Reference


The builder can be used standalone by passing a persistent class instance:

    new grails.orm.HibernateCriteriaBuilder(User.class, sessionFactory).list{
        eq("firstName","Fred")
    }
    
    
       /**or an instance can be retrieved via the createCriteria method of Grails
        domaon class instances**/
        
   def c = Account.createCriteria()
   def results = c {
        like("holderFirstName","Fred%")
        and {
            between("balance", 500,1000)
            eq("branch", "London")
        }
        maxResults(10)
        order("holderLastName","desc")
   }
   
   
   
   
org.hibernate
==============================================================
 Criteria is a simplified API for retrieving entities by composing Criterion
objects.  This is very convenient approach for functionality like
"search" screens where there is a variablenumber of conditions to be placed
upon the result set.



The Session is a factory for Criteria.  Criterion instances are usually obtained
via the factory methods on Restrictions. eg.

/***********Examples************/
List cats = session.create(Cat.class).add(Resitrictions.like("name","Iz%"))
    .add(Restriction.gt("weight", new Float(minWeight)))
    .addOrder(Order.asc("age"))
    .list()




Hibernate Criteria builders in Grails
=======================================================================
Dynamic finders work fine, but they may only take you 
so far.  For one thing, they are limited to top-level properties
of the class--youcannot use dynamic finders to search relationships

Criter Builders(they are a hibernate technology)

All Grails domain classes have a static method:
------------------------------------------------
    createCriteria()
    
that returns an instance of :
-------------------------------------------------
    HibernateCriteriaBuilder
    
This builder has a list method that takes a closure.  Inside this
closure, we can define the criteria for our search.  An example
is provided below:

def g3Events =  TekEvent.createCriteria().list{
    and{
            gt('startDate',new Date())
            or{
                ilike('description','%groovy%')
                ilike('description','%grails%')
                ilike('description','%griffon%')
            }        
   }    
}

^^^This code produces a list of the technical events that you
would be likely to find us attending.  More specificially, the
g3Events list would contain any TekEvent that contained the words:

    *   Groovy
    *   Grails
    *   Griffon

Whom's start date starts later than the current date.
The "and" and "or" blocks are self explanitory...and obviously
may be nested for deep queries.


Another nice feature of Criteria Builders is that relationshp properties
can easily be searched.  This is also done with nested
criteria blocks.  Let's see how this looks:

def contegixEvents = TekEvent.createCriteria().list{
    sponsorships{
        sponsor{
            eq('name', 'Contegix')
        }
    }
}


^^^ This code  assignes a list of  TekEvents that have related sponsors
that in turn all have a name spelled exactly as "Contegix"



def volunteerEvents = {
    if(request.getSession(false) && session.user){
        def user = session.user
        def tekEvents = TekEvent.createCriteria().list{
            volunteers{
                eq('id',session.user?.id)
            }
        }
        if(events){
            out<<"<div style='margin-left:25px;
            margin-top:25px;
            width:85%'>"
            out<< "<h3>Events you volunteered for:</h3>"
            out<<"url"
            events.each{
                out<<"<li><a href='"
                out<<"$createLink(controller:'tekEvent',action:'show',id:it.id)}'>"
              }
              out<<"</ul>"
              out<<"</div>"  
            }
        }
    }
}
