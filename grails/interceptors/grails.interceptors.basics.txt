=====================================
*	Support for static compilation

Defining an interceptor
=====================================
Like all Grails artifiacts, interceptors are simple Groovy classes.  They follow certain conventions that allow the framework to first identify and then augment them with 
a rich set of behavior of relevant to freqenty addressed tasks

Interceptors contain code for before and after routines to be executed 


Conventions regarding implementing interceptors
======================================
Interceptors are by convention are located in the same directory the controllers they are associated with:

	grails-app/controllers/

All interceptor names should be ended with the suffix : Inerceptor


Interceptor base syntax
