To whom it may concern,

I submitted an appleal for dismissal of the decsion for MD DUI to penalize me 
for not attending the <>.  I provided DUI with coresspondence with supporting evidence that
I did in fact attend this required course nearly 6 mounths ago and I had not recieved any correspondence 
regarding the matter since.   DUI claims that they sent a letter via US mail concerning my appeal date and that
was to appear in person to make my appeal, however I did not recieve this email(I am at a loss as to why DUI didn't
simply just inform me of this appeal date and that I was to appear in person via my online DUI claims account correspondence
inbox).

I am herby requesting to re-open the appeal, as I feel I should not be penalized for an infraction I clearly 
did not commit.


Thank you.
