# How to win contracts 


## Find Contracts 

There are a number of databases you can use to find federal contracts to bid on.
Similarly, there are multiple databases that government agencies use to find contractors.

## Dynamic Small Business Search
The Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) is a database that government agencies use to find small business contractors for upcoming contracts.  Small businesses can 
also use DSBS to find other small businesses to work with.

SBA maintains the DSBAS database.  The information yo jprovide when you register your business in the System for Award Management(SAM) is used to populate DSBS, so 
you sould create a comprehensive business profile

## Contract Opportunities
Federal business opportunities for contractors are listed at SAM.gov.  Government agencies are requied to use SAM to advertise all contracts over $25,000


## GSA SCHEDULES 
If you want to sell to the govenrment, securing a contract with the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) -- the government agency that connects government buyers with contractors -- is a great way to start.  Securing a contract with the GSA is also called "getting onto the GSA Schedule", which means you have benn approved to do business with the government.

## Subcontracting opprotunties 
SubNet is a database of subcontracting opprotunities posted by large contractors lookign for small businesses to serve as subcontractors.
SBA maintains a directory of fedderal government prime contractors with subcontracting plans

## Marketing to the government
You may want to market your small business directly to a government agency or prime contractor.  You can do that by 
learning what agencies or prime contractors need, and then showing them how your business can fulfill that need.

### Federal Procurement Data System 
Federal Procurement Data System - Next Generation is the repository of all federal contracting data for contracts over $25K.  With this system, you can see which agencies have contracts and with hom they have contracts, what agencies buy, and which contractos have contracts.

### USASpending.gov
USASpending.gov tracks government spending through contracts awarded. 
This searchable database contains information for each federal contract.  You can use this information to help idnetify procurement trends within the government and potenial opprotunities

### Small business offices
Many federal agencies have what's called an Office of Small and Disadavantaged Business Utilization(OSDBU) or an Office of Small Business Programs(OSBP).  These offices work to identify opprotunities to contract with small businesses.

Each agency releases a procurement forecast that includes contracting opprotunities for small and disadvantaged buinesses. Once you have reviewed an agency forecasrt and 
used systems like the Federal Procurement Data System and 
USASpending.gove to identify oppoortunities at a specific agency, you can contact that agency's smalle business office.
Also, each offic hosts training and networkign events to help small businesses identify contract opportunities.

## Handling protests 
When the government awards a contract, someone may allege that a winning business misrepresented itself, causing the contract to be awarded unfairly.



## Size and status protests
A losing bidder, contracting officer, SBA, or anothe rinterested party or government offical can file a protest, questioning a winning business' size or socio-economic status.In the event of a protest, SBA will detemine th esize or status of the winning small business.  If SBA determines that th ebuiness did not qualityfo the 
set-aside, the business is no longer eleigible for that contract. 
Any of the interested parties can appeal SBA's size determination to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals which issues a final decision

## Ceterificate of Competency
If a federal contracting cofficer regjects a low bid from a small business because of questios about the business' ability to fulfill the contract, the case is referred to SBA

SBA will then offer the small business a chance to apply for a Certificate of Competency(COC).  If the small business applies for a COC, SBA will review th ebusiness' ability to fufill the cotnract.  If the business demonstrates the ability to fulfill the contract, SBA will issue a COC to the contracting officer, requiring the award fo the contract to th esmall business. 
COC is only valid for the specific contract for which it is issued.  A small business that is capable of handling one contrct, may not be qualified to handle another

## Bundling and consolidation 
If you think a federal agency has engaged in bundling or consolidation practices that keep a small business from competing for a contract, contact your local Procurement Center Representative (PCR).

Bundling and consolidation are defined in Title 13 Part 125.1 of the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR).
