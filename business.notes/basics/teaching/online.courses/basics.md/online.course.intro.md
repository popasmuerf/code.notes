            - May also have quizzes to test learners along the way
    - Courses range of $250 to $2000
    - A multi-day course is ideal if you have already validated your idea through a mini-course

4. Test if your course has high market demand 
    - Build a minimum viable product (MVP)
    - A MVP is a product you release toth epublic with just enough reatures 
    to validate your assumptions.
    - Create a MVP of your course , such as a mini-course or a free webinar to validate our idea 


5. Create a mini-course 
    - Mini-courses generally take less than two hours to complete 
    - Narrow in on a specific toopic rather than attempting to cover a broad range of ideas.
    - A mini-course cold eventually be a module or lesson in a multi-day course.  
    - The following are examples of taking a broad course topic and narrowing it into a mini-course MVP:

    Multi-day course topic                                  Mini-course idea

    5.1 Pre-sell your course 

    - Pre-selling a course means selling your course before you have actually created it
    - This is another mitigation strategy to avoid creating a course nobody wants 

    - Other advantages include stress-testing yoru concept, tailoring your content to early feedback from buyers, and raising money through pre-sales to actualy fund the creatio of your course.

    - For example, use Shopify to create a pre-sale page and collect payments for your course.  To add pre-order functionality to your store, download an app from the Shopify App Store like 
        - Pre-order Now, 
        - Pre-order Manager
        - Crowdfunder

    - To pre-sell your course:
        * At the very least have a
            - title
            - topic 
            - course outline
        that gives early buyers an idea of the curriculum they will learn down the line 
        * Have a goal in mind of what a successful pre-sale might look like
        

    6. Outline your course content

        - Outlining your course content
        - Comining up with the contents of your course and logically divide it into lessons requires you to put yourself in the shoes of a sudent.
        - Start from teh desired end state of a student and work backward from there 

    6.1 Break down content into modules and lessions 

        MODULE 1 : Setting a Content Strategy 
        MODULE 2 : Writing Content that Converts
        MODULE 3 : Search Engine Optimization 
        MODULE 4 : Managing a Content Calendar
        MODULE 5 : Content Distribution


    From there, you can break down your modules into a series of specific lessions that 
    go into detail about a given subject matter and set your students up for success.  Here's how you migh t break down the above modules for the same course: 



MODULE 1: Setting a Content Strategy

    Lesson 1: Determine your editorial objectives and goals
    Lesson 2: Define your target customer and reader personas
    Lesson 3: Outline your customer content journey
    Lesson 4: Conduct competitor content research
    Lesson 5: Decide on content formats

MODULE 4: Managing a Content Calendar

    Lesson 1: Selecting your content calendar tool
    Lesson 2: Categorizing content on the calendar

    Lesson 2: Content refreshing and repurposing
    Lesson 3: Pitching to publications and newsletters
    Lesson 4: Syndicating your content 
    Lesson 5: Paid advertising and sponsorships




Once you have a clear outline that details the topics for each module and lesson, you should have a clear direction to start building your course content, one lesson at a time. Each lesson should have detailed steps, information, and exercises for students to work through. Within each lesson, aim to have clear learning objectives that students who buy the course will walk away with. 
Determine the course formats of your lessons

Depending on the type of course you decide to create, the medium of your course could take many different forms. For a mini-course that’s free or low-priced, you might opt for an email format where you limit the formats you use to text and some illustrative images or screenshots. 

However, for more intensive and higher-priced courses, it’s best to use multiple formats to keep your students engaged throughout the course. For example, rather than using only text or exclusively video, use a mix of formats to keep your students engaged. Here are a few popular course formats and their benefits:

    Video content: great for portraying ideas simply and time effectively
    Screencasts and walkthroughs: ideal for processes where students need to see the exact steps
    Text content: best for explaining concepts in more detail, giving step-by-step information, and linking to other resources around the web
    Downloadable content: excellent for cheat sheets, glossaries templates, and other tools that set learners up for success
    Workbooks: valuable for helping learners internalize concepts

As a best practice, keep videos under 10 minutes long and aim to create content that’s focused and actionable. During your research phase, look at what formats your competitors are using and consider asking prospective students about what course medium they find most engaging. 
7. Set course pricing and sales goals

The price of your course will vary based on the type of course you create: a mini-course is free or low-cost, a multi-day course is mid-cost, while a masterclass is usually high cost. However, the pricing of your course will depend on a variety of factors you should consider:

    Niche and course topic. Consider the industry your course falls in and how price sensitive your customers might be. Customers buying a course on investing likely have a higher willingness to pay than customers purchasing a digital course on social media marketing. 
    Marketing. How much do you plan to spend on marketing campaigns? Ensure that the cost of spreading the word about your course is reflected in your pricing. 
    Authority of the course creator. Buyers will pay more for a course created by someone who is considered a proven industry leader. Take your perceived authority into account while pricing your course. 

To get an even better idea of how you should price your course, conduct competitor pricing research to see how other digital course creators in your niche are pricing their own digital offerings. Ensure you’re not selling yourself short by pricing too low. On the other hand, remain realistic and avoid pricing too high. Don’t be afraid to study what competitors are offering, add more value to your own course offering, and price your course accordingly. 

Alongside doing dedicated pricing research around your course, set a sales goal that will also inform how you price and market your course. 

For example, if your sales goal is $50,000, there are several ways to price your course:

Scenario one:

    Goal: $50,000 in course sales
    Course price: $20
    Buyers needed: 2,500

Scenario two:

    Goal: $50,000 in course sales
    Course price: $250
    Buyers needed: 200

In scenario one, you price your course lower and need a higher volume of customers. In scenario two, you price your course higher and need a lower volume of customers. So, which scenario is better? 

Generally, pricing your course too low is not a good strategy. For one, you’ll need to spend time and money marketing your course to drive traffic to your course page. 

Assuming 1% of the customers who land on your page buy the course, you’ll need to drive 250,000 visitors to your page in scenario one and 20,000 visitors to your page in scenario two. Secondly, it’s often favorable to have customers who are less price sensitive. 

Consider these factors when pricing your course, and avoid pricing that’s too low and forces you to market more aggressively. Put the time and energy into creating a course that you’re proud to value at what it’s worth. 
8. Choose the right online course platform

Next, decide on exactly where you want to host your course content online. There are a range of different course platforms with unique features, but there are three basic types of online course platforms: standalone, all-in-one, and online course marketplaces. 
Standalone

Standalone platforms give you a lot of control over your content and data. Examples of standalone platforms include Thinkific and Teachable, both of which integrate easily with Shopify.
