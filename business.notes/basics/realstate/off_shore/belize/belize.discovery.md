					parties enlist a "third party"(neither buyer or seller)

					safer by protecting the assets of the buyer and seller
					until both parties have et their obligations for the 
					agreement.

				*	The escrow provider is a neutral third party who isn't
					concerned with whether the buyer or seller comesout ahead.
