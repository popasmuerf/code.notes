SQL ORDER BY clause
===========================================
The SQL ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data in ascending or
descending order, based on one or more columns.  some database sorts query results
 in ascending order by default.

##### example #########

use testDB; 
SELECT  * FROM customers ORDER BY salary  WHERE age like "_"  ;

SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY name, salary ;



Custom ordering using CASE
==========================================

select * from customers order by
(CASE address
when 
WHEN 'DELHI' 	 THEN 1
    WHEN 'BHOPAL' 	 THEN 2
    WHEN 'KOTA' 	 THEN 3
    WHEN 'AHMADABAD' THEN 4
    WHEN 'MP' 	THEN 5
    ELSE 100 END) ASC, ADDRESS DESC;
