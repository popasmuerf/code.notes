CSS & Twitter Boot Strap
======================

How do we make Bootstrap work for us ?
We need to link to it.  Before we linked our HTML files
to our custom CSS files....this time we use the link tag to do the same..
but this time we use it to link to the URL of where bootstrap resides:



link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.6/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>
