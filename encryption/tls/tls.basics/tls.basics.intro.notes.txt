Natural Earth is a public domain map dataset
available at 1:10m, 1:50m, and 1:110 million scales.
Featuring tightly integrated vector and raster data,
with Natural Earth you can make a variety of visually
pleasing, well-crafted maps with cartography or GIS software.



The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR ) 
series is prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Often called “the voice of CDC,” the MMWR  series
is the agency’s primary vehicle for scientific 
publication of timely, reliable, authoritative,
accurate, objective, and useful public health 
information and recommendations.



The Natality online databases report counts
of live births occurring within the United States
to U.S. residents and non-residents. Counts can be
obtained by state, county, child's gender and weight,
mother's race, mother's age, mother's education, 
gestation period, prenatal care, birth plurality,
and mother's medical and tobacco use risk factors. 
The data are derived from birth certificates.
For more information, refer to Natality data description.

Longitudinal Employer–Household Dynamics (LEHD) data 
are the result of a partnership between the Census Bureau
and U.S. states to provide high quality local labor
market information and to improve the
Census Bureau's economic and demographic data programs.
LEHD data are based on different administrative sources,
primarily Unemployment Insurance (UI) earnings data and
the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW),
and censuses and surveys. Firm and worker information
are combined to create job level quarterly earnings
history data, data on where workers live and work,
and data on firm characteristics, such as industry.
Access to these data will only be granted to qualified
researchers on approved projects with authorization 
to use specific data sets. All researcher access to
restricted–use data occurs at one of the secure 
Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (RDCs).
The table below lists person, job and establishment
based data available at the RDCs.




The OSTM/Jason-2 satellite launched 20 June 2008
and is the latest in a series of ocean altimeter 
missions designed to observe ocean circulation, 
sea level rise, and wave heights. Earlier altimeter 
missions include Geosat and Geosat Follow-On satellites,
which flew in 1985-1989 and 1998-2008, respectively, 
and the TOPEX/Poseidon (1992-2005) and Jason-1 (2001-present)
missions, which were launched into the same orbit now
occupied by OSTM/Jason-2. Jason-3 is a follow-on mission
to OSTM/Jason-2, which was launched on January 17, 2016.
Jaosn-3 will secure the continuity of high quality ocean
altimetry measurements in support of climate monitoring,
operational oceanography and seasonal forecasting.


Job-to-Job Flows (J2J) is a beta release from
the U.S. Census Bureau of new national statistics
on job mobility in the United States. The data
include new statistics on: (1) the job-to-job
transition rate, (2) hires and separations
to and from employment, and (3) characteristics
of origin and destination jobs for job-to-job
transitions. These statistics are available 
nationally and at the state level, by industry 
and worker characteristics. More information 
about the data and how they are generated is
available in the documentation links provided
on this page. More detailed tabulations are
planned in later releases. 



The linked birth and infant death data set is a
valuable tool for monitoring and exploring the 
complex inter-relationships between infant death 
and risk factors present at birth. In the linked 
birth and infant death data set the information 
from the death certificate is linked to the 
information from the birth certificate for 
each infant under 1 year of age who dies in
the United States, Puerto Rico, The Virgin Islands,
and Guam. The purpose of the linkage is to use the
many additional variables available from the birth
certificate to conduct more detailed analyses of
infant mortality patterns. The linked files include
information from the birth certificate such as age,
race, and Hispanic origin of the parents, birth weight,
period of gestation, plurality, prenatal care usage,
maternal education, live birth order, marital status,
and maternal smoking, linked to information from the 
death certificate such as age at death and underlying 
and multiple cause of death.

Each year thousands of banks and other financial institutions
report data about mortgages to the public as part of the 
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). This data is important
because:

    It helps show whether lenders are serving the housing
    needs of their communities; It gives public officials 
    insight that helps them make informed decisions about
    policies; and It sheds light on lending patterns that
    could be discriminatory

The CFPB provides every year of the Loan Application 
Register (LAR) data since 2007. That adds up to about
15 to 20 million records every year, and we think that you
could build something really cool with it.



The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), enacted by Congress
in 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901) and implemented by 
Regulations 12 CFR parts 25, 228, 345, and 195,
is intended to encourage depository institutions to help
meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. 
In this section of the web site, you can find out more about the
regulation and its interpretation and information on CRA examinations. 


This page lists our data that is available in multiple 
formats, including machine readable, static datasets,
RSS feeds, and more.  FEMA offers some of its public 
data in machine readable format via an Application 
Programming Interface (API).

Android Malware Tracker
Hi!

This is Android Malware tracker. Its main purpose is
to keep track of the Android malware HTTP C&Cs 
(and probably telephone numbers in the future). 
All of the links are verified manually and are live
when they are added. However, I do not guarantee that 
the links are in way suitable for the purpose that you 
have in mind. In other words: you are using it AS IS 
and you are responsible for anything that may happen.

Security Bulletins Service

AusCERT Security Bulletins contain information about threats,
vulnerabilities, patches and workarounds of an IT security 
nature that AusCERT believes would be of interest to our 
members (and the public). AusCERT provides up-to-date 
information on a range of software and hardware products,

 Virbl was a project of which the idea was
born during the RIPE-48 meeting in May 2004. 
The plan was to get reports of virusscanning
mailservers and put the IP-addresses that were 
reported to send viruses on a blacklist. Since 
the start, a number of trusted notifiers 
participated and over the next 10 years Virbl 
was a great addition to fighting back virus 
mails on the internet.

Hickory Hall 

1. I can pin it on the GOP because we have demonstrable, falsifiable
evidence that they are in fact 100% responsible for the switch when they
knew full well that the water was teaming with water born pathogens
and laced with nuerological destructive heavy metals like lead....
Now you can try and play this game where it was just a "cost saving"
manuever, and they had no idea what the state of that river was despite
everyone from the street to the state house being aware for decades how
utterly toxic the water from that river is...but somehow they also 
at the same time saw fit to provide GM Motors(you know...the guys whom
destroyed the river in the first place) with a clean water supply outside
of the river...pure "conincidence"...Im sure


2. What is it about the simple concept of "the Dems had no control over what
happened as full controll had been transferred to Snyder and his people" are
you having trouble comprehending ?  Let's assume that this easily dimissed
lie you keep repeating was true....the final say of whether or not the 
water supply is switched was up to Snyder...after being briefed on the impact
by both state and federal enviromental agencies....so now you basically have
a choice between Synder and his gaggle of Republican clowns being sociopathic
racist, liars whom litterally poisoned an entire town of black and poor white
people to provide tax breaks for already rich white people, or they are a bunch
of incomptent, reckless morons to the point of having commited manslaughter
with depraved indifference who could not be bothered to know whaat the possible
consequences where of switching a town's water supply to what ammounts to a river
of sewage so he could give a tax break to already rich white people.
So which one is it ?


3. No...No...No...the goddamned water supply was never supposed to be switched
in the first place...do you understand ?  I cannot tell if you honestly cannot
process this simple fact or you know that there is no logical out for you here
so you have to try and change the subject.
