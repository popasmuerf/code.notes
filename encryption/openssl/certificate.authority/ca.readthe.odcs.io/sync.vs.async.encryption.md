# Difference between Private key and Public key


## Private Key:

- In the Private key, the same key (secret key) is used for encryption and decryption.
- Cryptography is classified into 
    * symmetric cryptography
    * asymetric cryptography
    * hashing


## Private Key:
    - used for encryption and decryption
    - symmetric because the only key is copied or shared by another party to decrypt the cipher text
    - faster than public-key cryptography


## Public Key 
    - Involves two keys
    - Public Key used for encryption
    - Private Key is used for decryption

        -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        1.                          Faster                                          Slower     




        2.                          Used to encrypt/de-encrypt                      public/private key pairs are used
                                                                                    public key encrypts 
                                                                                    private key decrypts 


        3.                          private key is kept secret                      public key is shared 
                                                                                    private key is kept secret



        4.                          Symmetrical                                     Asymmetrical



        5.                          Sender/Reciever shares same key                 Public key is shared between hosts





        6.                          Key is private                                  Public key is public and private key is private





        7.                          Is an efficient technology                      Inefficient technology



        8.                          Typically used for encrypting large strins      Used for only short messages
