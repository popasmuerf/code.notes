What is continuous integration
===================================
Continuous Integration(CI) is a development
practice that requires developers to integrate
code into a shared repository at rgular
intervals.  This concept was meant to
remove the problem of finding later occurence
of issues in the build lifecycle.  Continuous
integration requires that the developers
to have frequent builds.  The common
practice is that whenever a code commit
occurs, a build should be triggered.
