Yeah...google is awesome....how many minutes did you spend furiously looking up the term ?  For those just tunning in..here is a quick summary of the shit-show this sub-thread has become

me: "yadda yadda yadda....I really want to look smart"
rand: "..well you don't look smart..."
me(trying to make nice): "don't be that way Rand"
rand(insisting on being an asswipe): "well you tried to be smart and failed"
me(losing my patience with rand's out of line ass): "Ok then..let's play..."

Guide to Working with Multiple Modules
===========================================

As seen in the intorduction to the POM, Maven supports 


The Reactor
===================================================
The mechanism in Maven that handles multi-module projects
is referred to as the "reactor".  This part of the
Maven core does the following:

	*	Collects all the available modules to buid
	*	Sorts the projects into the correct build order
	*	Builds the selected projects in order


Reactor Sorting
==================================================
Because modules within a multi-module build can
depend on each other, it is important that 
reactor sorts all the projects in a way
that guarnatees any project is built before it is
required.



The following relationships are honoured when sorting projects:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	*	a project dependency on another module in the build
	*	a plugin declaration where the plugin is another module inthe build
	*	a plugin dependency on another module in the build
	*	a build extension declaration on another module in the build
	*	the order declared in the <modules> element
