NgModule
===================================

	*	Angular is a platform and frame work that specializes in single page 
		applications  in HTML and TypeScript.

	*	Angular is written in TypeScript.  It implments core and optinal functionality
		as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps

	*	Modules in angular 
		-	declares a compliation context for a set of components.
		-	Compilation contexts are 

	*	The architectur of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts.

		-	The basic building blocs  are NgModules.
		-	NgModules provide a compilation context for components.
		-	NgModules collect related code into functional sets;
			an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.
		-	an Application always has at least a root module that enables
			bootstrapping, and typically has many more
			feature modules
		 



components
===================================
* Components define views
	-	Views are sets of screen of elements
	-	Angular chooses amoung various sets of screen elements of a view
		to dispaly based on associated business logic and or data
	-	A component is just a class replete with the "decorator" @Component
	-	Decorators provide the frame work with meta-data associated with the purpose
		of the component

	-	Component files :
		*	template
		*	component class
		*	component module(also a class) 


	//sample code for an Angular Component

	import{Component,OnInit} from '@angular/core' ;

	@Component({selector:'app-product-foo',
		   templateUrl:'foo.html'
		   styleUrls:['./foo.css']})

	export class Foo implements OnInit{
		constructor(){}
		ngOnInit(){}
	}





* Components use Servies
	-	Services provide specfic functionality not directly related to views.
	-	Services may be injected inot components as dependence, making your code 
		more modular
	-	A service is just a class replete with the "decorator" @Service
	-	A
