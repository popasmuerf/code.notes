Running Gradle Proj in Eclipse
=========================================
*This is how I am currently doing it.....
*Gradle dependencies are stored in ~/.gradle
*Add the gradle plugin in build.gradle
*Run on the commandline : gradle --refresh-dependencies 
*Run on the commandline : gradle eclipse-clean
*Run on the commandline : gradle eclipse
*If you havent already...you might have to remove(not delete!!) the project from eclipse and then
re-import as a gradle project
*During the re-import.....you project should build on it's on.  Your dependency jars will not be
visible in the "Project and External Depenendies" drop down


To Do
=========================================
*I still have yet to figure out where exactly these dependencies are located exactly.
*There is a good chance they are located by default in ~/.gradle  
*There is a .gradle directory within my project root....I wonder if I can specify this as the default ?
