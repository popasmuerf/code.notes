What is Hamcrest ?
=========================================================
Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects
allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaritive.
There are a number of situations where matchers are invaluable
such as UI validation, or data filtering
, but it is in the area of writing flexible tests
that matchers are most commonly used.  Hamcrest
is most often used for unit testing.


When writing tests it is sometimes difficult to get 
the balance right between overspecifying the test
(and thus making it brittle to changes), and not specifying
enoiugh(making the test valuable since it continues to 
pass even when the thing being tested is broken).  Having
a tool that allows pick out precisely the aspect under
test and describe the values it should have, to a 
contrlled level precision, helps grealty in writing
tests that are "just right".

A simple Hamcrest test
===================================================




Gradle and JUnit example
=====================================================
In Gradle, you can declare the JUnit dependency like this:

build.gradle
------------------------------------------------------------
apply plugin: 'java'
dependencies{
        testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
}



By default, JUnit comes with a bundled copy ob hamcrest-core
---------------------------------------------------------------
> gradle dependencies --configuration testCompile


Gradle + JUnit + Hamcrest
===========================================================
Normally we need the useful hamcrest-library
library, so better the JUnit bundled ocpy
of hamcrest-core and include the original 
hamcrest-core library:

//===============code===================//
apply plugin: 'java'
dependencies {
	testCompile('junit:junit:4.12'){
		exclude group: 'org.hamcrest'
	}
	testCompile 'org.hamcrest:hamcrest-library:1.3'
}


Gradle Tutorial : Part 4 : Java Web Applications
==================================================
In this part of the tutorial, we shall look at building 
Java Web Applications via Gradle.  As is teh pattern, we shall have multi-projectd scenario wher we will have one
Java project that has some utility class  and 
which is built separately.  And then we have a 
Java Web Project that is dependent on this project
and has JSP/Servlets and so on.

In the process of which...we ahsll look at 2 additional plugins that Gradle provides, which will make our
task easier.  The plugins are:

1.      War plugin:  this plugin allows us to compile
        and assemble a WAR(Web appliation Archive) file
        from our Java Web Application.

2.      Jetty Plugin:  This plugin allows us to run our web
        application inside of a a Jetty container.  Very
        useful to test out the project quickly

Project Scenario
==============================================================
for this episode, we shall look at 2 projects that are
arranged under a common directory.  Our root directoryh is going to be called "mywebapp" and inside
of that we shall have 2 folders that will contain individual
projects as shown below:

mywebapp
|-utils
|-web


1. Utils:  This project contains some utility code and 
   hence it will not depend on any of the other projects.
   The java code in this project depends on an
   external java Date Time Library: Joda Time.  
   So we will need to hae that dependency defined
   for this project.
2  web: This is the java Web application project, that just
   has simple servlet and jsp files, along with the web.xml
   file.  This project depends  on teh utils project
   since it uses the utility java class from there.
   Along with that dependency, it also has dependency on the
   servlet Jar file that is needed to complile Java
   HTTP servlet code 


Multiple Gradle files
==================================================
As we had seen in the last episode, it is better
to create multiple build.gradle files, so that we can customize and maintain the build specific requirments
for each project in a much more maintainable
fashion

In essence, what we are ending up with  is a structure that looks like the following:

/mywebapp
|- /utils
     |- build.gradle
     |- (Java Sources and files)
|- /web
     |- build.gradle
     |- (Java Sources , JSPs and files)
|- settings.gradle
|- build.gradle


Configuration of settings.gradle
======================================================
include ":utils" , ":web"


Configuration of build.gradle (global)
======================================================
subprojects{
        apply plugin:"java"
        repositories{
                mavenCentral()
        }
}


Configuration of build.gradle(utils)
=====================================================
apply plugin: "java"
dependencies {
 compile "joda-time:joda-time:2.9.4"
}

Configuration of build.gradle(web)
=====================================================
apply plugin: "war"
apply plugin: "jetty"
dependencies {
        compile project(":utils")
        compile "javax.servlet:servlet-api:2.5"
}

httpPort = 8080
stopPort = 9080
stopKey = "stopKey"


^^^^ Notice the additonal entries that we have added in
bold.  We have simply applied the Jetty plugin and 
also provided one of the standard properties (httpPort)
available to configure the jetty Web Server when it is
launched i.e. the HTTP port.  We have specified 8080 as
the value.  Additionally, we have provided the stopPort
and stopKey properties so that we can stop the Jetty
server from teh command line/terminal. 


---------------------------------------------
 
The WAR  plugin
=============================================
Here we are applying the war plugin.  As per 
the documentation: "The War plugin extends the Java
plugin to add support for assembling web application
WAR files.  It disables the default JAR archive
generation of the Java plugin and adds
a default WAR archive task"

The plugin also adds the war and assemble tasks to
the tasks available for the project:

classes <---------war<-----------assemble


Api
-----------------------------------------------
This project contains the application codea and
it depends on api and common
projects respectively

App
-----------------------------------------------
This project contains the application code
and it depends on api and common projects
respectively

Including Multiple Projects in a Build(edit settings.gradle)
====================================================
include ":api",":common",":app"

Common Configuration
======================================================
You are familiar with the build.gradle file, which is what
the Gradle command looks for in terms of what
it has to do.

Below is a a recommended and fairly intuitive structures
for the build.gradle file as shown below:
======================================================
allprojects{
        //global project build instructions
}
subprojects{
        //individual project build instructions
}



New avaible tasks under our Build tasks
=============================================
Now that we added the war plugin for one of our
sub projects....we should get this list after running the 
following commmand:

> gradle tasks

Build tasks
-----------
assemble - Assembles the outputs of this project.
build - Assembles and tests this project.
buildDependents - Assembles and tests this project and all projects that depend on it.
buildNeeded - Assembles and tests this project and all projects it depends on.
classes - Assembles main classes.
clean - Deletes the build directory.
jar - Assembles a jar archive containing the main classes.
testClasses - Assembles test classes.
war - Generates a war archive with all the compiled classes, the web-app content and the libraries.

Build Setup tasks
-----------------
init - Initializes a new Gradle build. [incubating]
wrapper - Generates Gradle wrapper files. [incubating]

Documentation tasks
-------------------
javadoc - Generates Javadoc API documentation for the main source code.

Help tasks
----------
buildEnvironment - Displays all buildscript dependencies declared in root project 'webapp'.
components - Displays the components produced by root project 'webapp'. [incubating]
dependencies - Displays all dependencies declared in root project 'webapp'.
dependencyInsight - Displays the insight into a specific dependency in root project 'webapp'.
help - Displays a help message.
model - Displays the configuration model of root project 'webapp'. [incubating]
projects - Displays the sub-projects of root project 'webapp'.
properties - Displays the properties of root project 'webapp'.
tasks - Displays the tasks runnable from root project 'webapp' (some of the displayed tasks may belong to subprojects).

Verification tasks
------------------
check - Runs all checks.
test - Runs the unit tests.

Web application tasks
---------------------
jettyRun - Uses your files as and where they are and deploys them to Jetty.
jettyRunWar - Assembles the webapp into a war and deploys it to Jetty.
jettyStop - Stops Jetty.

Other tasks
-----------
hello

Now that we have performed basic app assembly...
Let's assemble and run our app war
======================================================
> gradle jettyRunWar


navigate to url localhost:8080/web

This is what we should see...

Directory: /web/

META-INF/ 	4096 bytes 	Oct 18, 2016 1:26:57 AM
WEB-INF/ 	4096 bytes 	Oct 18, 2016 1:26:57 AM



Running granular tasks and builds 
============================================
Examples of running the hello task individually
for each project
-------------------------------------------------
> gradle -q api:hello
> gradle -q common:hello
> gradle api:build
> gradle common:hello



Running tasks specific to a build as opposed
to global settings for all subprojects
==============================================
project(':api'){....}
project(':common'){....}
project(':app'){....}

Configuring sub-project interdependency
==============================================
project(':app'){
        dependencies{
                compile project(':common')
                compile project(':api')
        }
}


Building the WAR file
====================================================
Since we have made the web project depend on the utils,
we can build the entire Web Application, by going to the
web folder in the terminal and firing the following 
command:

> gradle assemble
:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes UP-TO-DATE
:jar
:assemble
:utils:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:utils:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:utils:classes UP-TO-DATE
:utils:jar
:utils:assemble
:web:compileJava UP-TO-DATE
:web:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:web:classes UP-TO-DATE
:web:war

Note about the jetty plugin and gradle
=============================================
The Jetty plugin that is being used is deprecated
and is planned for removal in Gradle 4.0.
It's replacement Gretty is available at 
https://githum.com/akhikhl/gretty.  For now,
we will go ahead with the Jetty plugin
