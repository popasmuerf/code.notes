A fun metaphor is to think of Git as a timeline
management utility.  commits are snapshots of
a point in time or points of interest along
the timeline ofa ap project's history.
Addtionally, multiple timeline can be managed through the use
of branches.  When 'undoing' in Git, you are usualy
moving back in time, or to another timeline where mistakes
didn't happen.



Get the concise commit history
==================================
> git log --oneline
    Michaels-MacBook-Pro:ownership_lab mdb$ git log --oneline
    8d65654 (HEAD -> master) first commit


Get the concis commit history of all branches
=================================
> git log --banches=*
    commit 8d65654816d41164cbfe354692db2c24c446259f (HEAD -> master)
    Author: popasmuerf <MichaelBrown172@Gmail.com>

Get the concise histor of a particular branch
=================================
> git log <branch>




Checking out a commit later in the time line
of a branch
=================================
> git checkout <hash of past commit>

^^^Git chekcou is an easy way to "load" any
of these saved past snapshots onto your development 
kmachine.  During the normal course of development,
the HEAD usually points to master or some other 
local branch....but when you check out a previousl commit, HEAD no longer
points to a branch---it points directly to a commit.  This is known
as a "detached HEAD" stage.

You can checkout an individual file without moving the 
HEAD pointer to that specific commit in history.  You can
then commit the old version of the file ina new snapshot as you would any
other change.  So, in effect, this usage of

    >git checkout
on a file, serves as a way to revert back to an
old version of an individual file.



Viewing a snapshot in history
==============================================
Imagine that we started developing a crazy experiment, 
but we are not sure if we want to keep it or not.
To help us decide, we want to take a look at the state of the
project before we started our experiment.  First we need to
find the ID of the revision we want to see....


    Michaels-MacBook-Pro:ownership_lab mdb$ git log --oneline
    0e8bd3a (HEAD -> master) Added code for deep copy of heap data...
    8d65654 first commit


We can use

    > git checkout

to view our first commit using the following command:

    > git checkout 8d65654

This makes your working directory match the exact state of the
8d65654 commit....we can look at files, compile the project, run
tests, and even edit file without worrying about losing the
current state of the project....and NOTHING we do here will be
saved to our repo....


to get back to our current moment in time:

    > git checkout <master|name of branch you are on>



Undoing a committed snapshot
============================================
There are technically several different strategies to 'undo'
a commit.  

How to undo  a commit with git checkout
-------------------------------------
Using the git checkout command we can
checkout the previous commit [insert commit hash here]
Check out a specfic commit will put the repo in a 
"detached HEAD" state.  This means you are no longer
working on any branch.  In a detached state,
any new commits you make will be orphaned when you chang e
branches back to an established branch.  Orphaned commits
are up for deletion by Git's gabage collector.  The 
garbage collector runs on a configured interval 
and permantly destroys orphaned commits.  To prevent 
orphaned commits from being garbage collecge, we
need to ensure we are on a branch.



From the detached HeAD state, we can execute 

    279d9c8 (HEAD -> master) Added description of what goes on during the copy/move of values into functions depending on whether or not the
    value is a scalar(on the stack_ or a custom type that is dynamically allocated from the heap because it's size is not known at compile ti
    me....
    c1b4e42 Added code regarding function ownership...
    f79d8f8 Added info about the Copy trait
    2117dab More stack vs. heap stuff...
    0e8bd3a Added code for deep copy of heap data...
    8d65654 first commit

    >git checkout -b "branch from this past commit"

This will create a new branch named "branch from this past commit"
.  the repois now on a new history timeline in which the 
the former <insert the latest commit pointed to by HEAD > will now
no longer exists and will be considered "undone".

Unfortunately, if you need to the prevsious branch, maybe it was your 
master branch(OH SHIT!!!) this undo strategy is  not apporpiate.
Let's look at some other 'undo' strategies...


How to undo a public commit with git revert
=================================================




How to undo a public commit with git revert
=================================================
f81a17f (HEAD -> adding_numbers)  Added another addition expression....
d011f90 Adding shit
b0b6223 (master) Added info on how using git checkout for undoing shit isn't that smart..because you lose the time line you are branching
 off of....and if this is master....you are FUCKED
279d9c8 Added description of what goes on during the copy/move of values into functions depending on whether or not the value is a scalar
(on the stack_ or a custom type that is dynamically allocated from the heap because it's size is not known at compile time....
c1b4e42 Added code regarding function ownership...
f79d8f8 Added info about the Copy trait
2117dab More stack vs. heap stuff...
0e8bd3a Added code for deep copy of heap data...
8d65654 first commit



The history on branch "adding_numbers" includes d01190
commit. This time...let's try to revert 'undo'.  If we execute


	> git revert HEAD

git will create a new commit withthe inverse of the last commit.
This adds a new commit to the current branch history and now 
makes it look like:


1fbe8d6 (HEAD -> adding_numbers) Revert " Added another addition expression...."
f81a17f  Added another addition expression....
d011f90 Adding shit
b0b6223 (master) Added info on how using git checkout for undoing shit isn't that smart..because you lose the time line you are branching off of....and if this is master....you are FUCKED
279d9c8 Added description of what goes on during the copy/move of values into functions depending on whether or not the value is a scalar(on the stack_ or a custom type that is dynamically allocated from the heap because it's size is not known at compile time....
c1b4e42 Added code regarding function ownership...
f79d8f8 Added info about the Copy trait
2117dab More stack vs. heap stuff...
0e8bd3a Added code for deep copy of heap data...
8d65654 first commit


This is pretty awesome....basically we created a new commit that 
is the 'inverse' of the last commit(basically a commit that undoes the
changes for the previous commit.....) with that commit still existing
withing our time line.


this is the prefered method of undoing shit while working on a public 
shared repo....if your have requirements of keeping a curated and minimal git hsitory,
this strategy may not be satisfactory....



How to undo a commit with git reset
=======================================
For this undo strategy we will continue with
our working example. 

git reset is an extensive command with multiple
uses and functions.  if we invoke

	> git reset --hard <commit hash>

the commit history is reset to that specified commit in
time.  

	
	1fbe8d6 (HEAD -> adding_numbers) Revert " Added another addition expression...."
	f81a17f  Added another addition expression....
	d011f90 Adding shit
	b0b6223 (master) Added info on how using git checkout for undoing shit isn't that smart..because you lose the time line you are branching off of....and if this is master....you are FUCKED
	279d9c8 Added description of what goes on during the copy/move of values into functions depending on whether or not the value is a scalar(on the stack_ or a custom type that is dynamically allocated from the heap because it's size is not known at compile time....
	c1b4e42 Added code regarding function ownership...
	f79d8f8 Added info about the Copy trait
	2117dab More stack vs. heap stuff...
	0e8bd3a Added code for deep copy of heap data...
	8d65654 first commit




	Michaels-MacBook-Pro:ownership_lab mdb$ git reset --hard f81a17f
	HEAD is now at f81a17f  Added another addition expression....
	Michaels-MacBook-Pro:ownership_lab mdb$ git log --oneline
	f81a17f (HEAD -> adding_numbers)  Added another addition expression....
	d011f90 Adding shit

	Michaels-MacBook-Pro:ownership_lab mdb$



^^^ in our new reality....the events of 1fbe8d6 no longer exists...as 
if it never happened....


but take care.....this works just fine on a local repo....but if you are
working on a shared repo...and try to push to remote....git will throw
and error because you are trying to push events to what is more or less
now an entirely different reality. 



Undoing the last commit :
================================
So far we have the following methods of undoing
commits:
#obliterating entire time lines
#in order to start new ones...
>   git checkout <commit hash>
>   git checkout -b new_universe


#Reverting to the last commit but keeping all commits
#within our timeline...the best method of reverting changes
#when dealing with open projects...(inversing of last commit)

>   git revert HEAD


#Reseting your time line...such that what just happened...didn't
#...works great for personal, closed projects....but is awful
#for open projects...because now your local reality is no longer 
#the same reality

>   git reset -hard <commit hash>




Git: checkout a singl file froma specific commit
====================================================
Some times we mess arond with a file nd then there is a desire to
have a particular state of this file back to the workspace

How do we do that ?

	>	git checkout <commit hash> <path>


Example 

	>	git checlut 678ujki89786 /home/mikeyb/src/project/bean.java








For Hugh
=================================================

1. Log into FracWeb
2. While in Dashboard, look to the listing of services
   in the left most column
3. Select "Extractors" and you will then be redirected to
   the "Extractor Manage" page.
4. Within the "Extractor Manage" page, you will notice a listing
   of existing spiders.  Above that list you will see a button labled:
   "Create Spider".  Click on this button. You will then be redirected
   to the "Spider Create" page.

5. Within the "Spider Create" page, provide a name and mode
   for your  spider.  Once you are done, click the "back" button
   to be redirected back to the "Extractor Manage" page.

6. You should now see that your new spider is included at the bottom
   of the list of existing spiders.  Each spider in this table exists
   in a row that includes the spider's name, the template it is based off
   of, and an "info"(it looks like a little hand icon) and "delete" buttons. 

7. Click on the "info" button, and to the right of the spider list, 
   there should appear an "info" pane that includes 4 buttons: "start spider"
   , "stop spider", "spider crawls", "spider schedules".  Below these buttons 
   should be listings for "Change Log", "Group", "Type",
   "Modes", "Files()"

8. Under the "Files()" listing, you should see a table listing for the spider related
   files.  The files listed exist in rows that also incldue a button for
   editing and deleting the files(resembling a scratchpad and "x" respectively)

9. Locate the "spider.py" file within the Spider "Files()" table listing and click on 
   it.

10. You should not be presented with a pop up window displaying the contents of the file
   "spider.py".   Edit the spider, inserting code for the target website url to be
   "scraped", along with the "business" logic for extracting and processing scraped
   site data. Once you are done, click the "save" button int he bottom left, and you will
   be redirected back to the "Extractor Management" page with your new spider still selected
   along with it's accompanying  "info" pane to the right.

11. Within the right-most pane labled "Info", locate the "spider crawl"
	button.  Select a date range and then select and click the "search" button.
	Depending on whthe

12. Within the right-most pane labled "Info", locate the "spider schedule"
	button.  You should notice a button for adding a "rule".  Click this button
	You will then be presented with an option box presenting you with configuration
	options for:
		Mode(drop down menu)
		Crown expression(text field)
	In order to set a schedule for you new spider, you will need to convert
	the times of the day/week you want your spider to run automatically into
	a "cron" expression.  Here, I am using the website cronmaker.com to build
	these cron expressions.  This will change to a more human readable format
	later.

	Insert your new cron expression into the the "Cron expression" text field
	Select the crawl mode within the "Mode" drop down menu.

	Once you are done, click the "Save button" within this option box.  You will
	be redirected to the "Extractor Manage" page with your spider selected with it's
	corresponding right-most pane labled "Info".
