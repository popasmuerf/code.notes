Detached HEAD Branch
=================================
Normally it's advisable to check
out only the tip of a branch
by naming the branch directly.
By default:

	> git checkou

changes to the tip of the desired
branch.

You can checkout any commit that
you want tho...
==============================
Git creates a sort of anonymous
branch for us called :

	"detached HEAD"

a detached HEAD is created whenever:

	*	Check out a commit that is not
		the haead of a branch.
	*	Check out a tracking branch which
		you might do to explore 
		changes reently brought into
		your repository from a remote
		repository

	*	Checout the commit reference
		by tag.  You might do this to 
		put together a release based
		on tagged versions of files.

	*	Starting a git bisecting operation

	*	Us te git submodel update cmmand

Example of Git creating a detached
HEAD
==============================
> git checout v1.6.0
Note: moving to "v1.6.0" which is't
a local branch.
If you eant to create a new branch frm
this checkoui, may do so (now or later)
by using -b with the checkout command
again.  Example:
HEAD is now at ea02eef...  GIT 1.6.0

How do we figure out if we are on 
a detached HEAD or not ?
===============================
> git branch
*(no branch)




A Basic Example of Checking
out a Branch
=================================
*	Files and directories present
	in the branch being checked
	out but not in the current branch
	are checked out of the object store
	and placed in your working tree

*	Files and directories present
	in your current branch but absent
	in the branch being checked out will
	be removed from your working tree

*	Files common to both branches are
	modified to reflect the content 
	present in the checked out branch





Checking out When you have uncommited
changes
======================================
File and directories that are not 
being tracked are left alone....

tracked, modified files that have not been
added and not commited
will cause you to recieve an
error if you try to switch...

A branch checkout can be forced via
using the "-f" option flag:

> git checkout <branch> -f


Merging Changes into a different Branch
========================================
> git checkout -m <target branch>

Caution: Git will merge the file(s)
changes...but...be forewarned....
any conflicts that arise will be
included in the new merged file...
and git wont tell you that there
are conflucts
