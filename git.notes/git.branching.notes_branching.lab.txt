A Basic Example of Checking
out a Branch
=================================
*	Files and directories present
	in the branch being checked
	out but not in the current branch
	are checked out of the object store
	and placed in your working tree

*	Files and directories present
	in your current branch but absent
	in the branch being checked out will
	be removed from your working tree

*	Files common to both branches are
	modified to reflect the content 
	present in the checked out branch





Checking out When you have uncommited
changes
======================================
File and directories that are not 
being tracked are left alone....

tracked, modified files that have not been
added and not commited
will cause you to recieve an
error if you try to switch...

A branch checkout can be forced via
using the "-f" option flag:

> git checkout <branch> -f
