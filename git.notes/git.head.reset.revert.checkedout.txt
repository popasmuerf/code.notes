HEAD
====================================
        *       last commit snapshot, next parent
        *       The HEAD in Git is the pointer to the current branch
                reference which is in turn a pointer to the 
                last commit you made or the last commit that
                was checed out into you rworking directory.
        *       Generally HEAD is the snapshot of  your last commit

        *       View current head : 
                //syntaxt
                > cat .git/HEAD

        *       View current head : 
                //syntaxt
                > cat .git/refs/heads/master

        *       View changes between your last local commit
                and your most recent pull
                > git diff HEAD
                

git diff
=================================================
Shows the changes between the working directory and the index.  This shows what has been changed,
but is not staged for a commit.


git diff --cached
------------------------------------------------------
Shows the changes between the index and the HEAD(pointer to last commit on this branch).  This shows what has been added
to the index and staged for a commit.


git diff HEAD
----------------------------------------------------------
Shows the changes between the working directory and HEAD
(which includes changes in the index).  This shows
all the changes since the last commit,



What is the git "index"(cache)
===============================================
The git "index" is where you place files you want
committed to the git repository.  Index is also known as:
        *       Directory Cache
        *       Current directory cache
        *       Staging area
        *       Staged files

Before you "commit" (checkin) files to the gir repository,
you need to first place the fiels in the git "index"
