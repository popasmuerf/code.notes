Git Object types
==============================
At the heart of Git's repository
implementation is the object store.
It contains:
	* original data files
	* log messages
	* author information\
	* dates
	* other info required 
	  for rebuilds
	* version info

Git only deals with 4 types of objects
===================================

Blobs(Binary large objects)
---------------------------------
Each version of a file is represented as a blob.  The
internal structured is ignored
by the program.  A blob is treated
as being opaque.  A blob holds a file's data but not  any metadata
about the file or even it's name.


Trees
--------------------------------
A tree object represents one level
of directory information.  It 
records pertaining to blobs:
	*	identifiers
	*	path names
	*	meta-data for all the
		files in a directory
	*	meta-data for recursive
		access to other (sub)tree
		objects and thus build a
		complete hierarchy of files
		and subdirecdtories
