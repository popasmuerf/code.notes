Git Index
==============================
Most VCS allow you to edit in your
working directory and ommit your
changes to your rository for
safekeeping.  Git works similarly
but inserts another layer:

	The index

The index is inserts the index
"layer" between the working directory and the repository to stage.

	Index-------------
					 |
					 v
	working_dir --->stage---->repo


The index is used to stage, or
collect alterations:

	1. edit working directory
	2. accumulate changes in the index(staging)
	3.	commit changes to your local repo
	4. push your local repo to
	   your current branch

We can think of the index as a set
of intended or prospective modifications where you are able
to add, move, or repeatedly edit files right up to the culminating 
commit, which actualizes the
accumulated changes in the repository.



Linus says it's all about the Index
===================================
Linus Torvalds argued on the Git mailing list that you can't 
grasp and fully appreciate the 
power of Git without first 
unserstanding the purpose
of the index.


Git's index doesn't contain any
file content; it simply tracks
what you want to commit.  When
you run :

	> git commit

Git checks the index...as opposed
to the current state of your 
native files system to determine what should be eligible for a commit.  Git's "higher level" commands are designed to 
hide the details of the index
from you and make your job easier,
it is still important to keep the
index and its state in mind.

Querying our Index
===============================
We can query the state of the 
index at any time with the command

	git status

It explicity calls out what files
Git considers staged.

We can peer into the internal
state of Git with "plumbing" commands such as:

	git ls-files


We can use the command:

	git diff

during staging to display two
differnt sets of hcanges:

	*git diff
		-changes that remain
		 in your working dir
		 and are not staged

	*git diff --cached
		-shows changes that are
		 staged and will be
		 included within your
		 next commit




It contains:
	* original data files
	* log messages
	* author information\
	* dates
	* other info required 
	  for rebuilds
	* version info

Git only deals with 4 types of objects
===================================

Blobs(Binary large objects)
---------------------------------
Each version of a file is represented as a blob.  The
internal structured is ignored
by the program.  A blob is treated
as being opaque.  A blob holds a file's data but not  any metadata
about the file or even it's name.


Trees
--------------------------------
A tree object represents one level
of directory information.  It 
records pertaining to blobs:
	*	identifiers
	*	path names
	*	meta-data for all the
		files in a directory
	*	meta-data for recursive
		access to other (sub)tree
		objects and thus build a
		complete hierarchy of files
		and subdirecdtories

Commits 
-------------------------------
A commit object holds metadata
for each change introduced into the
repo including:
	*	author
	*	committer
	*	commit date
	*	log message
	*	pointer to tree object
Each commit object points to a captured instance of a tree object
in one complete snapshot.  The snapsot is capture in time of an instance of the state of the repo
The intial commit ...the "root" commit has no parent.

Most commits have one commit parent..though it is possible to have a 
commit that can reference more than one parentl.



Tags
--------------------------------------
A tag object assigns an arbitrary yet persumaby human readable name
to a specific object, usually a
commit.  
Although the following refers to
an exact commit  :

	 9da581d910c9c4ac93557ca4859e767f5caf5169

It might be a tad more convienient to use a tag for any particular commit such as  Ver-1.0-Alpha 

Index
-----------------------------------
---
The index is a temporary and dynamic
binary file that describes the directory structure of the entire
repository.  More specifically,
the index captures a version of the
project's overall structure at
one moment in time.

A projects state could be captured
by a commit and and atree from any
point in the project's history, or
it could be a future state toward
which we are actively developing.

Indexing allows for the seperation between incremental development steps and the commita of those changes

How git works high level
==================================
	*	execute commands that stage
		changes in the index:
			- add files
			- delete files
			- editing files
	*	changes are recorded by
		index..keeping them safe
		until a commit or an unstage

	*	Indexes may be moved or 
		removed
	*	Indexes allow for gradual
		tansistions from one repo
		state to another
	*	Indexes are essential for
		all merges


Cotent-Addressable Names
===============================
The git object store is organized and implemented as a content addressable storage system.  Specifically, each object in the 
object store has a unique name produced by applying SHA1 to the
contents of the object, yeilding
a SHA1 hash value.  Because the  complete contents of an object
contribute to the hash value
and the hash value is believed to 
be effectively unique to that
particular content, the SHA1 hash
is a sufficient index or name for that object in the database.  Any
tiny change to a file causes
the SHA1 hash to change, causing
the new version of the file
to be indexed seperately.

Git users speak of SHA1, hash code, and Object ID interchangeably.


Note : Globally Unique Identifiers
====================================
Identical content has the same ID globally..regardless of the physical location of that identical data.  The same file content residing in two or more differnt places share the same
Object Id/hash/SHA1 number.  Think
of this id as a GUID.


Git is more of a content tracking system than a VCS
========================
* Git allows you to internally manipulate data with ease

* Git only tracks hashes...not file names or anything else...
again...content is what matters here.

* if two seperate files have the 
exact same content...git stores
a single copy of that content as 
a blob within the object store...
whether those two files reside in
the same directory or not...

* git computes hases based on file/directoy content alone

* If a change occures to a file/directory..then a new hash 
is computed for that file/directory

* all original files remain in the
object store.

* git only stores every version of ever file...not the changes to each file.

Pathname Versus Content
=================================

^^^Git's physcial data layout isn't modeled after teh user's
file directory structure.  
Instead, it has a completely
different structure that can
nonetheless reproduce
the user's orginal layout.

Git's internal structure is a more
efficient data structure for
its own internal operations
and storge considerations.
