Git Branches
==============================================================
A branch is he fundamenal means of launching
a seperate line of development within 
a software project. A branch is a split
from a kind of unified, primal state,
allowing development to continue simultaneously
and , potentially, to produce
different versions of the project.  Often,
a branch is reonciled and mereged with
other branches to reunite disparae 
efforts.

Git allows many brnaches and thus many
different lines of development
within a repository.  Git's branching
is lightweight and simple.  Moreover,
Git has first rate support for merges.

As a result, most Git users make routine
use of branches.  This chapter


Reasons for Using Branches(common
rational):
=============================
*	A branch often represents an
	individual customer release.
	If you wan to start version
*	A branch can encapsulate a dev
	phase, such as the prototype,
	beta, stable, or bleeding-edge
	release.  you can think of
	the version 1.1 release as 
	a seperate phase, also;
	the maintenance release.
References are pointers to commits
=====================================
Refrences are pointers that come in several flavors:
---------------------
*local branch
*remote branch
*tag

Local branch reference
----------------------
On disk, a local branch reference consists entirely of a file
in your project's directory:

	.git/refs/heads

This file contains the 40 byte identifier of the commit that
the refernce points to...and that's it.  The entire 40 bytes

You might have heard people talk about how Git allows "cheap branching."  This is 
(part of) what they mean.  Creating a branch in Git just means writing
40 bytes to disk, which is why :

	git branch foo

is so fast...

The reference reference
====================================
The main difference between the difference
type of references...although they all point 
to commits in your repository....is how and when they
move.

Local branch references
-------------------------------------
are specific to a single repository: your local one.
commands that affect local branch references include:
	*commit
	*merge
	*rebase
	*reset

Remote branch references
-------------------------------------
...are also specific to a single repository,
but one that's previously been defined as a remote.
Commands that affect remote branch references include:
	*fetch
	*push


Tag references
-------------------------------------
Are basically like branch refernces that never move. Once you've
create a tag, it will never hcange(unless explicitly updated by you )
The immutability of tag references make them great for establishing
specific versions of a software package, or making exactly what got deployed to a production
server on a particular date.  Only one option and  one command  that I know of affects tags references
	* --refresh
	* tag


Branching and Git record 
keeping
===========================
Git doesn't keep information
about where a branch originated.
Instead, the branch name moves
incrementally forward as new commits
are made on the branch.

Older commits are accessed
via their hashes..or via
relative names like dev~5(five
back from the latest commit
in the dev branch)

If you need to keep convenient
track of a particular branch
commit, then just give it
a tag.

We can also use the orginal
fork point at which our branch
and the branch from which it derived

#CLI string
> git merge-base ogrinal-branch new-branch

How to think of a branch name
=============================
as a pointer to an yet-to evolve 
and evolving commit


On rebuilds of repos and branches
=================================
if a branch is currently at commit/HEAD
"Z"...then in order to rebuild "Z"
You will need all the commits back
from "Z" all the way to the 
original fork




Merging
==================================
Merges are the compliments of branches.
That is...a merge is the inverse
of a branche.


Note:
=====================================
Most Git visual tools hide commits from you....
Conspirancy theory....?
