#Cloud Computing Planning


Before deploying applications to cloud, it is necessary to consider your business requirements.  Following are the issues one must consider:

- Data Security and Privacy Requirement
- Budget Requirements
- Type of cloud : public vs private vs hybrid
- Data backup requirements
- Training requirements
- Dashboard and reporting requirements
- Client access requirements
- Data export requirements


To meet these requirements we need to have a plan...the
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) offers a pretty good template with little modification for achieving this.


##Strategy Phase
In this phase, we analyze the strategy problems that customer might face.  There are two steps to perform this
analysis:

-   Cloud Computing Value Proposistion
-   Cloud Computing Strategy Planning


##Planning Phase
This step performs analysis of problems and risks in the cloud application to ensure the customers that the cloud computing is successfully meeting their business goals.  This phase involves th efollowing planning steps:

-   Business Architecture Development
-   IT Architecture development
-   Requirements on Quality of Service Developlent
-   Transformation Plan Development


##IT Architecture Development
In this step, we recognize the risks that might be
caused by cloud computing application from a business
perspective.


##Requirements on Quality of Service Development
Quality of service refers to the non-functional requirements such as reliability, security, disaster recovery, etc.  The success of applying cloud computing
mode depends on the se non-functional factors.



##Transformation Plan Development
In this step , we formulate all kinds of plans that are
re4quired to transform current business to cloud computing modes


##Deployment Phase
This phase focuses on both the above two phases.  It involves the following two steps:

-   Selecting Cloud computing Provider
-   Maintenance and Technical Service
