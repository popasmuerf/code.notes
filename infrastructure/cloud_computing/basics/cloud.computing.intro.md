Service Models
Cloud computing is based on service models. These are categorized into three basic service models which are -

Infrastructure-asâ€“a-Service (IaaS)
Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
Anything-as-a-Service (XaaS) is yet another service model, which includes Network-as-a-Service, Business-as-a-Service, Identity-as-a-Service, Database-as-a-Service or Strategy-as-a-Service.

The Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is the most basic level of service. Each of the service models inherit the security and management mechanism from the underlying model, as shown in the following diagram:

##IaaS

-   Base resources
-   Infrastructure as a Service
-   Network, Virtual Servers, Network Storge

##PaaS
-   Runtimes
-   Web Servers, Directory Servers
-   DNS Servers 
-   Deployment tools such as Jenkins and Git

##SaaS
-   application
-   CRM
-   EMAIL
-   Games
-   Virtual desktop

##Benefits




##Benefits

Cloud Computing has numerous advantages.  some of them
are listed below

1. One can access applications as utilities, over the internet

2. One can manipulate and configure the applications online at any time

3. It does not require t oinstall a software to access or manipulate cloud application
4. Cloud Computing offers online development and deployment tools, programming runtime enviroment through  **PaaS model**
5. Cloud resources are available over the network in a manner that provide platform indempendent access to any type of clients.
6. Cloud Computing offers **on-demand self-service** . The resources can be used without interaction with cloud service providers.
7.  Cloud Computing is highly cost effective because it operates at high efficiency with optimum utilization.  It just requires an Internet connection.
8.  Cloud Computing offers load balancing that makes it more reliable.


##Risks related to Cloud Computing

Although cloud Computing is a promising innovation with 
various benefits in the world of computing, it comes
with risks.
Some are featured below

1. **Security and Privacy** Arguably the primary concern about cloud computing.  Since data management and infrastructure management in cloud is provided by third-party, it is always a risk to handover the sensitive information to cloud service providers

2. **Lock In**
   It is very difficult for the customers to switch from one Cloud Service Provider(CSP) to another.  It results in dependency on a particular CSP for service.

3. **Isolation Failure**  The risk involves the failure of isolation mechanism that separates storage, memory, and routing between different tenants.
   
4. **Management Interface Compromise**  In case of public cloud provider, the customer management, interfaces are accessible through the Internet
5. **Insecure or Incomplete Data Deletion**  It is possible that the data requested for deletion may not bet deleted.  It happens because either of the following reasons
   * Extra copies of data are stored but are not available at time of delection
   * Disk that stores data of multiple tenants is destroyed.


#Characteristics of Cloud Computing
There are four key characteristics of cloud computing.

1. **On Demand Self Service** Cloud Computing allows the users to use web services and resources on demand.  One can logon to a website at any time and use them.
2. **Broad Network Access**  Since cloud computing is completely web based, it can be accessed from anywhere and at any time.
3. **Resource Pooling** Cloud computing allows multiple tenants to share a pool of resources.  One can share single physical instance of hardware, database and basic infrastructure.
4. **Rapid Elasticy**  It is very easy to scale the resources vertically or horizontically at any time.  Scaling of resources means the ability of resources to deal with increasing or decreasing demand.  The resources being used by customers at any given point of time are automatically monitored.
5. **Measured Service**  In this service cloud provider controls and monitors all the aspects of cloud service.  Resource optimization, billign, and capacity planning etc. depend on it.
