The layer underneath HTTP is a transport layer protocol.  Almost all HTTP traffic
travesl over TCP, though it is not required by HTTP(UDP could work just as well).



When a user types a URL into th ebrowser, the browser first extracts the hostname from the URL
as well as port number(default is 80)

*	Extracts URL and port(default port is 80)
*	Browser/client opens a socket
*	Browser/client begins writing data to the new socket
*	The trasport protocol, may or may not resend the data...if it is reliable....
