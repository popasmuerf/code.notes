URL encoding
=========================
RFC 3986 (The law of the URLs) defines that all safe characters
to be alphanumeric plus a few safe ones like
	:
	/

unsafe characters
--------------------------
# : used to delimite a fragment
^ : isn't always transmitted correctly via web services
\s : the space character can sometime mysteriously disapear when the URL is printed out


how we transimit unsafe characters
------------------------------
Fortunately, you can still transmit kunsafe characters in a URL, but all unsafe characters must be
encoded with a perscent sign "%" followed by some url coding
For example the "\s" character is encoded as:
	%20

^^^where the int 20 is the ascii encoding for space characters.

As a more complex example, if I wanted to create a URL for a file named:

	^my resume.txt

The resultant URL would look something like:

	http://host.net/%5Emy%20resume.txt

where:
	^ : %5
	" ": %20
