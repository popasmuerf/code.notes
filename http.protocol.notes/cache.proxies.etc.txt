HTTP reverse Proxie
===============================
Are public facing and may be used for
load balancing web apps behind them




HTTP forward proxy
===============================
Are used in intra-nets where they
often serve as pain in the asses
for their users via blocking sites
like imgur that help maintain your sanity.




Public cache
===============================
Cache that is shared among multiple uses
Public cache usually resided on proxy servers.
Cache on a forward proxy usually caching popular resources
commonly used by users....for example...at NPS....
Amazon.com and Netflix are probably in the 
forward proxy cache.



Private cache
==================================
Private cache are for single uses.
The private cache may be more familiar to people
as  Internet Explorer's "Temporary Internet Fies",
or users of Google Chrome as the "about:cache"  "url".


Cache Rules(lolz....I see what I did there..)
==================================================
	* 200 (OK) server responses to GET requests are by default cached
	  in HTTP 1.1 (meaning that proxies and clients may cache in response)	
	* Applications may influence this default caching via the header
		Cache-Control
			-or-
		Expires
	* The Expires header is deprecated but still widely used.
	* The header:
		Pragma 
	  is also used to control caching behavior, but like Expires...it is only still
	  used for backwards compatibility reasons.

HTTP response values for Cache-Control
===================================================
	*	public
	*	private
	*	no-cache

	*	A value of public means public proxy servers can cache the response.
	*	A value of private means only the user's browser can cache the response.
	*	A Value of no-cache means on one should cache the response.
	*	A Value of no-store means the message might contain sensitive information and not only should the 
		message not be cached, orsaved, but the browser should remove the message from memory
		as son as possible

Example of a partial response from Flickr.com for one of the Flickr CSS files
