What is the Actor Model ?
=============================
The actor model was originally invented by Carl Hewitt in 1973.

Inthe Actor Model, an application is broken up into small units of execution called actors.

These actors encapsulate the behavior and state ofa part of the appliction.

^^^Sounds like actors are similar to objects
in standard OOP...which istrue, however,
what distinguishes an actor from a 
standard object is a third property:

	communcation.


Actors never intreact dirctly with each other and instead communictae via messages.  the state of an actor is isolated from th rest o fhte sysemtem, and as such an actor never has to worry about snchronization issues, such as thread locking, when modifying its state.


Actors may be further organized as a hierarchy....whereh there are actors that are parents of child actors and so 
forth.  Parents may delegate work to its child...allowing for fault tolerance and 
scaling.
