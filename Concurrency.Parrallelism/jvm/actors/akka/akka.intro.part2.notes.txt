Introduction to Akka..(Again)
--------------------------------------

The Actor model is not new
and has been around since 1973..
..why now ?
=======================================
	*	successful, distributed systems
		msut cope in an enviroment where 
		components crash without responding

	*	Messages get lost witout a trace
		on the wire

	*	Network latency fluctuates.

	*	The above problems occur
		regularly managed intra-datacenter enviroments even
		more so in virtualized architectures

How does Akka(and the actor model in general deal with the above issues ?)
==========================================
	*	Multi-threaded behavior without
		the use of low-level concurrency
		constructs like:
			-	atomics
			-	locks

	*
