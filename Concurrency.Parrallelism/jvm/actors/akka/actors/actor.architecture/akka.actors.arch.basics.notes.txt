Akka Architecture
=============================



The Akka actor hierarchy
=================================
	*	actors always belong to a parent
	*	typcially an actor is created via
		callying:

			//code

				getContext().actorOf()

		Which instead of creating a 
		"freestanding" actor, this injects
		the new actor as a child into an
		already existing tree:  The creator
		actor becomes the parent of the newly
		created child actor.  You might
		ask then, who isthe the 
		parent of the first actor you crate ?




	*	New actor instances can be created under an actory using

		//code

			system.actorOf()

	*	Creation of an actor returns a refernce that
		is a valid URL.
