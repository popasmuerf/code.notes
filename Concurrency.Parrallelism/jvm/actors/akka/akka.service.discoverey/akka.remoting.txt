Remoting(codename Artery)
==============================================================

Remoting enables Actor systems on different hosts or 
JVMs to communicate with each other.  By enabling
remoting the system will start listening on a 
provided network address and also gaisn
the ability to connect to other systems 
through the network.


Trom the application's perspective, there is no
API difference between local or remote systems, 
ActorRef instances that point to 
remote systems look exatly the same as 
local ones: they can be sent messages to,
wathed, etc.  

Every ActorRef contans hostname and port information
and can be passed around even on the netowrk.

Thsi means that on a network eery ActorRef is a uniqu
identifier of an actor on that network.


Remoting is not a server-client technology.  All systems using
remoting can contact any other system on the netowrk
if they possess an ActorRef pointing to 
those systems.  This means that
every system that is remoting enabled acts as 
"server" to which arbitrary systems
on the same nework can connect to.
