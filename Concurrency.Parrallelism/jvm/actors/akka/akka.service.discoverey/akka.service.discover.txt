These are the two issues that he is currently working through. 

1. Scheduler cron representation 
2. Managing/Keeping track of crawlId, which he needs to do things like 
   creating, starting,displaying stats of, and stopping a spider
   Currently there is no easy way for him to persist state, but he is 
   looking at work arounds.

He just signed off, but will answer anyother questions 
I may have in the morning his time.

He believes that early next week is a reasonable estimate.


...but anyways, I am sort of leading The Extractor project.  It makes use of AkkaHttp....and we are having some issues









Akka Management
==============================================


Service Discovery
-----------------------------------------------
Akka discovery provides a simple inerface around 
various ways of locating services such 
as DNS or suing configuration or key-value stores like
zookeeper, consul etc.

What is Service Discovery(Que es Serviso discovery ?)
-----------------------------------------------------
Akka's Service Discovery talks speckfically discovering hosts
and ports that relate to some logical name of a service


If you are looking for a way to discover
Actors in a Cluster, you may want to look at the 
Receptionist pattern from Akka Typed instead.

Since it provides a more fine-tuned towards 
Actors mechanism of doing the disovery 

Discovery Method: Akka DNS Discovery
----------------------------------------------------
The most natural form of service discovery is to use
DNS as the source of truth regarding available services.  In
the simplest version, we quer for a service
name-which each cluster manager, such as Kubernetes, 
Mesos or others define using their own naming schemes,
and expect to get back a list of IPs that are
related to this service.


***Mechanism 
======================================================

Note: Akka Seeds...what are they ?
--------------------------------------------------------
As the number of nodes is not known in the 
beginning and can vary over time, it's useful to
have a Seed node to form the cluster.  Seed node
is an actor system without any actors, and it's used as
and entry point to the cluster for nealy created nodes.

You may set your sees in the application.conf file:


akka{
	actor{
		provider = "cluster"
	}
	remote{
		log-remote-lifecycle-events = off
		netty.tcp{
			hostname = "127.0.0.1"
			port = 0
		}
	}
}

cluster{
	seed-nodes = [
	"akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2551",
	"akka.tcp://ClusterSystem@127.0.0.1:2552"
	]
}


#Disable legacy metrics in akka-cluster
akka.cluster.metrics.enabled=off




Case 1: "Initial" Bootstrap process
-------------------------------------------------------

*	New node is started, desiganted ---> Node-1

*	The node discoveres its "neighbors" using akka-discovery
	(e.g. using DNS)
	-	This is NOT enough to dafely join or form a cluster,
		some initial negotiation between the nodes
		must take place
*	The node starts to probe the Contact Points of the
	disovered notes(which are HTTP endpoints, exposed
	via Akka Management by the Bootstrap Management Extension
	) for known seeds to join.

*	Since no cluster exists yet, none fo the contacted nodes
	return any seed nodes during the probing process
	-	The stable-margin timout passes, and no discover
		changes are observed as well
	-	At least akka.management.cluster.bootstrap.required-contact-point-nr
		nodes have been discovered.
	-	Communication with all discovered Contanct Points
		have been confirmed via successful HTTP 
		request-response

	-	The nodes all decide(autonomously) that no cluter
		exists, and a new one should be formed,
		they know all their addresses, and decide that the"lowest"
		sorted address is to start forming the
		cluster.

	-	The lowest address node(e.g. "A") notices the same,
		and makes the decision to join itself.

	-	Once the lowest addressed node has joined itself, it has formed
		a new cluster

	-	Other nodes, including X, will notice that A has
		notice that A has started returning itself as 
		a seed-node in the Contact Point responses.

	-	Any node, including X, immediately joins such
		seed node that it has obsered in the Contact
		Point process.

	-	Nodes continue probing the other nodes, and
		eventualy will notice any of the existing
		nodes that are part of the cluster, and
		immediately join it.  The phase is referred to
		as "epidemic joining".

	-	Eventually all nodes have joined the same
		cluster, the process is complete.



Case 2: Bootstrap process, with existing cluster
========================================================

The Bootstrap process in face of an existing cluster in a 
deployment is very simple, and actually if you
read through Case 1, you already seen it in action.


*	New node is started, called "X"
*	The node discovers its "neighbors" using akka-discovery(DNS)

*	The node starts to probe the Contact Points of the discovered nodes
	(http endpoints) exposed via Akka Management by the 
	BootStrap Management Extension for known seeds to join

*	The cluster already exists, and when probing the various nodes node
	X will recieve at least one seed-node adddress from the
	contact pts
	-	The node joins any discovered(via contact point probing)
		and immediately become part of the cluster
	-	The process is complete, the node has successfully
		joned the "right" cluster

	-

Akka behind NAT or in a Docker container
=========================================================
In setups involving Network Address Translation(NAT),
Load Balancers or Docker containers the hostname and 
port pair that Akka binds to will be different than
the "logical" host name and port pair that is used
to connect to the system from the outside.


akka{
	remote{
		netty.tcp{
			hostname = my.domain.com #external (logical) hostname
			port = 8000	#external (logical)  port
			bind-hostname = local.address  #internal (bind) hostname
			bind-port = 2552	#internal (bind) port
		}
	}
}
