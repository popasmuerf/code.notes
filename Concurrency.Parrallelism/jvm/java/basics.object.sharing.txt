Memory visibility
===================================================
        *       A visibility is subtle

        *       Single thread  enviroment if a value
                is written to variable with no
                intervening writes, you can expect
                to get the same value back

        *       Multi-threaded progams makes no
                guarantee that a thread reading
                a value written by another 
                thread on a timely basis or at all
                (this seems counter intuitive...but
                not really...as with threads it all
                comes down to timing which is not
                deterministic)

        *       In order to ensure visibility of
                memory writes across threads,
                we must use synchronization 

            

        

NoVisibility illustration of what can go wrong
when thereads share data without synchronization.
==================================================
Two threads, the main thead and reader thread, acce the shared variables :

        ready
        number

The main thrad starts the reader thread and then sets
number to 42 and ready is true, and then prints
out number.  while it may seem obvous that
NoVisibility witl print 42, though it is possible it
will in fact print 0 and never terminate at all!!!

...and thus this code could loop forever because
the ready flag may never be updated as far as
ReaderThread is concerned....it could still print out.
This phenomenon is known as:

        "reordering"

..as there is no guarantee that operations in 
one thread  will be performed in the order given
by the program, as long as the reordering is not
detectable from whith that thread -- even if the 
reordering is apparent to other threads.  When the 
main thread writes first to number and then to ready
without synchronization, the reader thread could see those
writes happen in the opposite order, or not at all.

Note: Reordering is not a design flaw
----------------------------------------------
JVMs are built to take full advantage of the 
performance of modern multi-process/multi-core
hardware.  For example, in the absense of
synchronization, the Java Memory Model permits
the compiler to reorder operations and cache values in
registers, and permits CPUs to reorder operations and cache
values in processor-specific caches....so it is not 
always a good idea to synchronize everything....



NoVisibility
===================================================
NoVisibility is about as simple as a concurrent
program can get---two threads and two shared variables
and yet it is still all too easy to come to the wrong
conclusions about what it does or even whether it will
terminate.  Reasonsing about insufficiently synchronized
concurrent programs is prohibtively difficult.

This may all sound scary, and it should.  Fortunately,
there is an easy way to avoid these complex
issues: Always use the proper synchronization whenever
data is shared across threads.


-----------------Code---------------------------
public class NoVisibility{
        private static boolean ready ;
        private static int number ;

        private static class ReaderThread extends Thread{
                public void run(){
                        while(!ready)
                                Thread.yield() ;
                        System.out.println(number) ;
                }
        }

        public static void main(String[] args){
                new ReaderThread().start() ;
                number = 42 ;
                ready = true ;
        }
}

Stale Data
====================================================
        *       Unless synchronization is used
                every time a variable is accessed,
                it is possible to see a stale
                value for that variable.
        *       Staleness is not all-or-nothing:
                a thread can see an up-to-date value of
                one variable but a stale value of aother
                variable that was written first
        *       Stale values can have disasterous affects
                in mission critical software
        *       Reads without synchronization is analogus
                to using READ_UNCOMMITTED isolation level
                in a database, where you are willing
                to trade accuracy for performance

@NotThreadSafe
public class MutableInteger{
        private int value ;
        public int get(){return value;}
        public void set(int value){this.value = value;}      
}

        //As opposed to

@ThreadSafe
public class MutableInteger{
        @GuardedBy("this")private int value ;
        public synchronized int get(){return value;}
        public synchronized void set(int value){this.value = value;}      
}

ExecutorService
==============================================
ExecutorService was introduced in Java SE 5.0, on of the most ground breaking Java updates when it comes to concurrency.
Despite it being more than a decade old, many developers still facd issues when using htis
handy interface:

	/* Code */

	ExecutorService pool = new ThreadPoolExecutor(10,10,0L, TimeUnit.Milliseconds), new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1_000)) ;
