## Math of Public Key cryptograhy





## NOTE:
So basically sharing a public key isn't no longer as counter intuitive as I previously thought it was.
It doesn't matter if an interloper who tapped my line knows about my public key.  The point is that 
they need my private key to actually decrypt any of the messages. Which they do not have...and vice 
versa with respect to whoever I am communicating with.
