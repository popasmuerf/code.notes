Getting started with spring boot
========================================
Spring Boot lets us rapidly create rock solid applications
As an example, look at the following surce code written in
Groovy in app.groovy:

@RestController
class App{
        @RequestMapping("/")
        def home(){
                "Hello,world!!!"
        }
}


Beleive it or not...the above code is a complete,
working web app.



What's going on here ?
================================
The spring tool parsed app.groovy
and spotted the @RestController
annoatation.  This tipped it off
to add Spring MVC to the classpath
using Groovy's @Grab
anootation (srping also does this if it spots
@Controllerd or @EnableWebMvs).  It makes our
app look like the following code:

//@Grab("spring-boot-starter-web")
//@Grab("groovy-templates")

@RestController
class App{
        @RequestMapping("/")
        def home(){
                "Hello, world!!!"
        }
}



@RestController
-------------------------------
Annotation asks Spring MVC
to look for web routes.  This 
annotation also indicates that
every HTTP endpoint in this
class will write its results
directly into the HTTP response
instead of using a view


@RequestMapping
-------------------------------
annotation maps the home()
method to the route : "/"
The name of the method matters not
at all



Running the app
===============================
> spring run app.groovy

Navigate to : localhost:8080

Hello, world!



Notes:
=============================================
The annotation:

        @Grab

is part of Groovy Grape, a tool that pulls
down third-party libraries from Maven central

The spring-boot-stater-web package is a
Spring Boot package thatpulls in all
the dependencies needed for Spring MVC app

The groovy-templates package gives us the option
to use Groovy's built-in template support
which we aret't using in this examplebut is
included nonetheless....
