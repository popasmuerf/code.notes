How Ubuntu will eventually end Apple's computing 
divsion as we know it...
=======================================================


Linux in the late 90's and the early 00's
------------------------------------------------
* Things were still a bit rocky
* Why?  More or less formats and applications
  where still extremely partisan....a lot of people
  blamed Java for not "delivering on it's promise"..
  except for the fact that they keep leaving out
  how java did infact deliver on this promise..on platforms
  that were not lorded over by entities dedicated to 
  killing this promise at the time(I am looking at you
  Microsoft and to  a lesser extent Apple and even NetScape)
* Things started to pick up tho....Linux had been steadily
  taking over backend/enterprise enviroments where open
  standards where a must.....a game Microsoft has(had) been
  fighting against valiantly...and LOSING...in fact M$ 
  has had it's ass handed to them so soundly that they have
  totally made a complete 180 degree turn on this....Think 
  about this...M$ did insanely STUPID and counter-productive
  moves(that cost millions) like creating an analog to Java
  and the JVM...both designed to be platform agnostic...that
  effectively(until recently) was only viable in the M$
  ecosystem as M$ made absolutely no effort worth mentioning
  otherwise...and their ridiculously stupid decision...again
  up until recently to refuse the use  ssh in lieue of




I want a Unix....one that I can use on a daily basis
for my daily work....oh...wait....OS-X
----------------------------------------------------
* If I am developing a web application using open web
  technology....why should I spend 1000 plus dolloars
  more on a technology that is 3 years behind ?
