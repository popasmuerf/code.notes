Use of Elements vs. Attributes
============================================
Data can be stored in child elements
or in attributes.  In XML, there are no
rules about when to use attributes, and 
when to use child elements:



<person sex="female">
  <firstname>Anna</firstname>
  <lastname>Smith</lastname>
</person>

        -OR-

<person>
  <sex>female</sex>
  <firstname>Anna</firstname>
  <lastname>Smith</lastname>
</person>



There are no rules in XML to when to use
attributes or when to use child elements
for denoting values
========================================
I have found it best practice to use attributes
in HTML but elements for XML...we should avoid
using attributes when data actually feels like
data, and not an attribute or charactersitic 
of something
