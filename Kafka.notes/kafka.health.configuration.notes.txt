Before we begin
=====================================
*	Verify that Kafka is configured to report
	metrics via JMX

*	You can communicate to ZooKeeper(usually on port 2181)


*	Confirming that (for Kafka) that the JMX_PORT
	enviroment variable is set before starting your
	broker (or consumer or producer) and then confirming
	that you can onnect to that port with JConsole or
	telnet...etc


*	For ZooKeeper we can run this one=line which used
	the 4-letter word :

	>	ruok : echo ruok | nc <ZooKeeperHost> 2181


	^^^ If ZooKeeper respnsd with imok, you are
	ready to install the Agent.





Install the DataDog(Conmon-Agent)
==============================================
	*	Install the agent : https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent

Configure the Agent
==============================================
	*	Create a config file for both ZooKeeper and 
		Kafka

	*	Agent configuration directory for specific platforms
		can be found here : https://docs.datadoghq.com/guides/basic_agent_usage/

	*	Sample config files that will be present in your install
		of the client:

			-	kafka.yaml.example
			-	kafka_consumer.yaml.example

	*	Copy the folloing to your brokers

			-	kafka.yaml
			-	kafka_consumer.yaml

	*	On producers and consumers copy only the following
			-	kafka.yaml

	*	If you are using ZooKeeper's default configuration, you
		shouldn't need to change anything in
			-	zk.yaml
