Encryption and Authentication using SSL
==============================================================

Step-1 : Genereate SSL key and certificate for each Kafka broker 
------------------------------------------------------------------
The first step is to deploy one or more brokers with the 
SSL suport is to generate the key and the ceertificate
for each machine in the cluster.  You can use Java's keytool
utility to accomplish this task.  We will generate the key into a temporary
keystore initially so that we can export and sign it later with 
a CA

	*	Junit:
		-	Usese refletion to parse @Test annotation
			to get the test methods and then invoke 
			them.
	*	Spring
		-	dependency injection 	
	*	Tomcat
		-	web container to forware request to correct module by
			parsing their web.xml files and request URI
	*	Eclipse:
			auto completion of method names
	*	Struts:

	*	Hibernate:


The list is endless and they all use java refelction
because all these frameworks have no knowledge and
access of user defined classes, interfaces their methods, etc

^^^LOLz...what rubbish.  If you are unable to discern what your kata is doing "on the 
surface"...then either you are unfamiliar with your own martial art, or you are looking
for someting that isn't there in the first place.

When should we not use reflection
===============================================
We shouldn't be using reflection in normal programming where we

already have access to the classes and interfaces because
of the following drawbacks:

*	Poor Performance:
	-	dymanic resolution of types involves processing lise
		scanning the classpath to find the clas to load,
		causing slow peformance

*	Security Restrictiosn:
	-	Reflection requires runtime permissims that might not
		be available for  system running under security manager.
		this can cause you applicaiton to fail at runtime
		because of the security manager

*	Security issues:
	-	Using refelction we can access par of code that we are not supposed
		to access.  For example, we can access private fields
		of a class and change it's value.  this can be 
		be a serious security thera and cause our application to 
		behave abnormally

*	High Maintenance:
	-	Reflection code is hard to understand and debug, also any
		also, any issues iwth the code can't be found at compile time because
		the classes might not be available, making it less flexible
		and hard to maintain.
