# Commands 

- Nearly all of the functionality of the CMake language is captured in the set of commands
available for execution, including 

    * variable initialization 

        set

    * conditionals

        if

    * iteration

        for
        while
        etc


Arguments to commands in CMake languge are separated by white space


CMake version 3.0 introduced a Lua-style bracket notation that allows command 
arguments to be surround by double, square brackets
