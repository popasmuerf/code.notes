Offline websites/apps
========================================

Offline websites are copied to local hard drive and accessed whenever th euser
needs to whiught any internet connection.  Likewise, this offline web
app will let you create a web application that is downloaded to its entirety to the mobile
devices of a user who can access that offline.

An application for this type may include app having collection of stories,
short tutorials or any other offline  content of users' interest, which he/she can read offline even when internet is not available
****************************************************************************


Application implementation
========================================
Teh application istself is implemented as a web page,
by default a local file named index.html, that references whatever CSS,
JavaScript, images, media files, or other resources are necessary for it to run.
All apps execute at as a WebView within the native application wrapper, which you distrubte to 
app stores.


The Cordova-enabeld WebView may provide the application with its entire user interface.  On some
platforms, it can also be a compoenent with a larger, hybrid application that mixes the WebView with
native application components.


Plugins
========================================
Are used for communication between Cordova and native components.
This allows for invocation of native code from JS.  Plugins are generally(should be consistent)
across platforms.  Plugins are available via the plugin registery.  You may also develop your own
plugins.  Cordova provides a plugin development guide


Development Paths
=========================================

Basic Components
=======================================
The File layout and configuration follows the specification
of W3C's Packaged Web App, or widget specification

Note:
=============================
config.xml -- contains app configs
index.html -- homepage of web app content
*.html -- should contain relative paths only in ther hrefs.  Absolutel paths not allowed


Note:
==============================
You may have noticed that the data folder is missing in the 
apss online mod...because all the files reside on the 
atual server and are accessible via the interwebs
