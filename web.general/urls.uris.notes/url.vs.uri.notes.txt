URL vs. URIs
==================================================


Uniform REsource Identifier(URI) is a compact sqequence of characters
that identiffies an abstract orphysial resource.



A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.  The
term "Uniform Resource Locator"(URL) referes to the subset of URIs
of URIs that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a mens of locating the
resources by descrbing its primary access mechanism(e.g. its network location)



From wikipedia:

"One can classify URIs as locators(URLs),or as names(URNs), or as both.
A  URN functions like a person's name, while a Uniform Resource Locator
represents a persons address.


A URI is a URL when  we include things like access mechnisms like "http://" or "ftp://"

*   ftp://ftp.is.co.za/rfc/rfc1809.txt    ---> also a RRL because of the protocol
*   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396 --->  also a UrL because of the protocol
*   files.hp.com ---> this is a URI only as http://files.hp.com might provide something 
                      totally differint than ftp://files.hp.com


Summary:

    1.  URIs are identififes, and that can mean name, location, or both
    2.  All URNs and URLs are URIs, but the opposite is not true
    3.  All URIs are not URNs and URls
    4.  The part that makes something a URL is the compbination of the name
        and an access method, such as:
            *   https://
            *   mailto://
            *   ftp://
            
    5. If you are discussing something that's both a full URL and a URI
        (which all URLs are), it'sbest to call it a "URL" because it's most
        specific
