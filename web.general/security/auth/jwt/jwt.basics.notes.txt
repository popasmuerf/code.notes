HTTP is stateless.
All the requests are stateless
Situations arise where we need to keep state
	-	shopping carts
	-	last page visited
	-	etc

We maintain state via sessions or tokens


Session Based Authentication

In the session based authenication, the server will create a session 
for the user after the user logs in.  The session id is then
stored on a cookie on the user's browser

The session id is then stored on a cookie on the 
user's browser.  While the user stays logged in, th ecookie would be
sent along with every subsequent request.  The server cna then 
compare the session id stored on the cookie against the session 
information stored oin the memory to verify user's indentify and
sends response with the coresponding state!

cookie{sessionid}

  |--------------POST /user/login---------------->|
  |						  |
  |						  |
  |<-------------RESP cookie{sessionid}-----------|
  |                                               |
  |						  |
  |--------------GET/POST/PUT cookie{sessionid}-->|
  |                                               |
  |                                               |
  |<-------------RESP-----------------------------|
  |                                               |





Token Based Authentication 

Many web applications use JSON Web Token(JWT) instead of session for
authentication. In the token based application.  In the token
based appliation, the server creates JWT with a secret
and sends the JWT to the client.  The client stores the JWT 
(usually in local storage) and includes JWT in the header 
with every request.  The server would hten validate
the JWT with every request from the client and sends a
response.





Browser
  |
  |--------------POST /user/login---------------->|
  |						  |
  |						  |
  |<-------------RESP JWT-------------------------|
  |                                               |
  |						  |
  |--------------GET/POST/PUT JWT signed Header-->|
  |                                               |
  |                                               |
  |<-------------RESP-----------------------------|
  |                                               |




The major difference between sessions and jwt is that the user's
state is not stored on the server....the server just needs to know 
that you who you say you are....nothing more....this scales quite nicely.



JWTs also allow for work across multible domains....as..once again...
the server has no concept of the requesters' state.
So you could hypothetically maintain the same state simultaneously 
on multiple devices accessing the same resources(I do this all the time using
YouTube and Amazon)....you can't do this with session based authentication..
because differing state would have to be mitigated on the server side.


JWTs tend to be larger than cookies as they usually contain more information:

	header
	payload
	sig

JWTs should not contain any sensitive inforamtion to avoid XSS attacks.


JWTs allow us to pass authentication to other applications.
