One of the most impotant apspects of Splunk is it's vast apps and addon base

   generally contains required field extractions, lookups, saved searches
   and others
   
   For example...Splunk does not out the box support data extraction, field meta
   data, look up functions, etc for GCP, AWS, or Azure
   
   
2. Apps delivers user experience that makes data immediately useful typically
   with pre-built dashboars that that makes data easy to anaylyze
   - Apps take care of a lot of the stuff you will need out the box....
        - dashboards
        - metrics
        - reports 
        
        
        
 3. Support
    -   Splunk Supported
