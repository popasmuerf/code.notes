Valid XML Documents
=====================================
An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".
An XML document valideated against a DTD is both "Well Formed" and "Valid"


Valid XML Documents?
======================================
A "Valid" XML document is "Well Formed" XML document, which also confors to the rules of a DTD.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "Note.dtd">
<note>
<to>Tove</to>
<from>Jani</from>
<heading>Reminder</heading>
<body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>

^^^^The DOCTYPE declaration , in the example ablve, is areference to an external DTD file.
The content of the file is shown in the paragraph below:

XML DTD
------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of a DTD is to define the structure of an XML document.  It defines the 
structure with a list of legal element:

<!DOCTYPE note
[
<!ELEMENT note (to,from,heading,body)>
<!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT from (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT heading (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)>
]>

^^^The DTD about is interpted like this:
The DTD above is interpreted like this:

!DOCTYPE note defines that the root element of the document is note
!ELEMENT note defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
!ELEMENT to defines the to element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT from defines the from element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT heading defines the heading element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT body defines the body element to be of type "#PCDATA

NOTE:  #PCDATA
-----------------------------------------------------
#PCDATA means parse-able text data




When to Use a DTD/Schema
======================================
  *   With a DTD, independent groups of people can agree to suse a standard DTD for interchanging data
  *   With a DTD, you can verfiy that the data you recieve from the outside world is valid
  *   You can also use a DTD to verify your own data
  *   If you want to study DTD, please read the DTD tutoiral
When not to Use a DTD/Schema
======================================
  *   XML does not require a DTD/Schema
  *   Whe you are experimenting with XML, or when you are working with small XML files, creating DTDs may be a waste of time.
  *   While developing software, you should wait until the specification is stable before you add a document definition.  It  is best to avoid validation errors.
