Redis  is an in-memory data stor that keeps its entire data set in a memory
and uses disk space only as a secondary persistent storage.

Therefore, Redis can provide very fast read adn write operations.


The catch is that Redis can only scale a database to the amount of memory on
whatever computer that is hosting it....



The other features of Redis include:


*	Support for complex data types
*	Multiple persistence mechanisms
*	Master-slave replication
*	Implementation of the publish/subscribe messaging pattern




Supported data types:

*	String
*	List
*	Set
*	Sorted set


Persistence(it supports two types of persistence mechanisms)

*	RDB
	-	takes snapshots from in-memory
	-	stores snapshots on disk
	-	
*	Append ONly File(AOF)


Publish/subscribe messaging pattern
