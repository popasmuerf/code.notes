About /robots.txt


In a nutshell
===============================================
Web site owners use the /robots.txt file to give 
instructions about their site to web robots; this 
is called the:

	The Robots Exclusion Protocol

It works like this:  a robot wants to visit a
web site URL, say --> http://www.example.com/welcome.html

Before it does so it firsts checks for and finds :

	http://www.example.com/robots.txt

The "User-agent: *" means this section applies to 
all robots.  

The "Disallow: /" tells the robot that it should not 
isit any pages on the site.


Some important consciderations
=============================================
	*	robots can ignore your /robots.txt
		...this includes malware bots that 
		scan the web for security vulnerabilities,
		and email address harvesters used by spammers
		will pay no attention.

	*	the /robots.txt file is a publically avialable file
		Anyone can see waht sections of yoru server you
		don't want robots to use.


	*	So basically robots.txt is usefless as far as
		site security is concerned.

	*	Your best option is a decent whitelist and firewall
		rules.
