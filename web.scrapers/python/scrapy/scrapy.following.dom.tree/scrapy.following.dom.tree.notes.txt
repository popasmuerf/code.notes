Extracting more URLs
======================================
Up to now, we have been working with a single
URL that we set in the spider's:

	*	start_urls

properties. It's a tupl, we can
hardcode multiple URLs, for example:


	start_urls = (
		'<url-0>',
		'<url-1>',
		'<url-2>',
		'<url-3>',
		'<url-N>',

	)

We can also use a file as the source of those
URLs as follows:


	start_urls = [i.strip() for i in open('todo.urls.txt').readlines()]


What will happen more often than not is that a website of
interst will have some index pages and some listing pages.
For example



Traversing the DOM
============================================================
	*	Horizontally:
		-	from an index page to another
	*	Vertically:
		-	froma n index page to the listing pages to extract Items




"yield" as opposed to "return"
==========================================================

	*	 yield:
		-like "return" in the sense that it returns values to
		the caller. However, in contrast to return, it doesn't 
		exit the function, bu continues with any data routine instruction
		that it may find itself encapsulated within.
		"yield" is a bit of Python arcane magicks that allows for 
		efficent routine writing.

class EasySpider(CrawlSpider):
	name = 'easy'
	allowed_domains = ['web']
	start_urls = ['http://www.web/']
	rules = (Rule(LinkExtractor(allow=r'Items/'),
	callback='parse_item',
	follow=True),
	)
	def parse_item(self, response):
		...


Link Extractors
-----------------------
What are they are ?
Link extractors are objets whose only purpose is to extract
links from web pages(scrapy.http.Response objects) which will
be eventually followed.


We will now set :

	start_urls 

to our first index page, and replace


What if we don't set a callback in our Rule sets ?

I am going to need all these "constitutional scholars" to understand
that The Constitution is not a sacred, inviolate  document handed
down to us by The Seven Gods of Andalos. It was designed SPECIFICALLY
to be modified as needed.  I am also going to need you to undertand
that The Founding Fathers were not infallible demi-gods...hence the
reason they specifically designed The Constitution to be modified as
needed.
