========================================


Both Rquest and Response classes have
subclasses which add functionality
not rquired in the base lasses.
These are described below in 
Requeste subclasses and Response subclasses...


#Code
===================================================


class QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "quotes"

    def start_requests(self):
        urls = [
            'http://quotes.toscrape.com/page/1/',
            'http://quotes.toscrape.com/page/2/',
        ]
        for url in urls:
            yield scrapy.Request(url=url, callback=self.parse)

    def parse(self, response):
        page = response.url.split("/")[-2]
        filename = 'quotes-%s.html' % page
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(response.body)
        self.log('Saved file %s' % filename

^^^^methods
----------------------------------
*	start_requests(self):
	-	returns an iterable of
		Requests(but you man return
		a list of requests or write
		a generateor function)

*	parse(self,response):
	-	Method called to handle
		the response downloaded for
		each of the rquests made.
		Each instance of Response holds
		the page content and has further
		helpful methods to handle it.


	    parse() usually parses the response,
	    exracting the scraped dta as dicts
	    and also finding new URLs to follow and
	    creating new Requests from them





Request objects
======================================
class scrapy.http.Request(url[, callback, method='GET', headers, body, cookies, meta, encoding='utf-8', priority=0, dont_filter=False, errback, flags])


^^^^
A Request object represents an HTTP request, which is usually generated in the Spider and executed by the Downloader, and thus generating a Response.
