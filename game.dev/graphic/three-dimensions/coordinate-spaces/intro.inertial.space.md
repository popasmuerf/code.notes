## Intertial Space 


- The intertial space is the "halfway" space between object space and world space.
- the origin of inertial space hast he same origin as object space, and the axes of 
inertial space are parallel to that of th eworld space axes. 


- to transform a point from object space to inertial space requires only a rotation 
and to transform a point from inertial space to world space rquires only a translation
