javafx.animation.AnimationTimer



Game components
===================================
*	sprites engine
*	collision engine
*	physics enginer
*	actor engine



javafx.scene.layout.StackPain
===================================
*	StackPane lays out its children in a back-to-front stack
*	The z-order of the children is defined by the order of the children list with the 
	0th child being the bottom and the last child on top.

		StackPane Z-Order
		--------------
			nth-child
			|
			|
			|
			|
			|
			|
			|
			|
			0th-child

*	The stackpane will attmpt to resize each child to fill its content area
	If the chld could not be sied to fillthe stackpane(either because it was not resiable or its max size prevented it) then it will be aligned within the area using the alignment property, which defaults to
	Pos.CENTER.

*	StackPane code example:

	StackPane stack = new StackPane() ;
	stack.getChildren().addAll(new Rectangle(100,100,Color.BLUE),new Label("Go!"));


javafx.scene.layout.StackPain
===================================
*	StackPane lays out its children in a back-to-front stack
*	The z-order of the children is defined by the order of the children list with the 
	0th child being the bottom and the last child on top.


javafx.scene.image.ImageView
===================================
* The ImageView is a Node used for painting images loaded with Image class.
This class allows resising the displayed image(perserving the original aspect ratio or not) and specifying
a viewport into the source image for restricting the pixels displayed by this ImageView.

/* Example code using ImageView */

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.geometry.Rectangle2D;
import javafx.scene.Group;
import javafx.scene.Scene; 
import javafx.scene.image.Image;
import javafx.scene.image.ImageView;
import javafx.scene.layout.HBox;
import javafx.scene.paint.Color;
import javafx.stage.Stage; 

public class HelloMenu extends Application{

	@Override 
	public void start(Stage stage){
		Image image = new Image("flower.png");
		ImageView iv1 = new ImageView();
		iv1.setImage(image);
	}
	

}
