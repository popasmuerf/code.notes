Swing vs JavaFX
========================================
Swing is still supported but it has been deprecated
and no new work is being done on enhancing swing.


Differences from JavaFX
---------------------------------------
Classes hold the user interface
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The interface is called a frame and is defined via class:

	JFrame

A frame is essentially an empty window to which you can add a panel, which serves
as a container for you user-interface elements.  A panel is defined by the class

	JPanel

The Jpanel is is used to place user-interface components.
JavaFX uses

JavaFX uses a lot of theater metaphores..
-------------------------------------------
JavaFx uses the metaphor of a theater to model te top-level
containers of an application.

Stage
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Defined by the Stage class.
Higher level container.
Typically a window on some operating systems
A sgate may contain a 
	Scene

In theatrical parlence...The stage is where all the scenes of
a theatrical play may take place.....:

Stage
	|
	scene0
	|
	scene1
	|
	scene2
	|
	scene3

Stage0
	|
	scene0
	|
	Stage1
	|
	scene2


Scenes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
*UI components are encapsulated within a scene
*Applications may have more than one scene
*Only one scene my be displyaed on the "stage" at anny given time
*scenes contain a scene graph, which is the most important concept in JavaFX
*What are scene graphs?
	-is a collection of al the elements that makeup a user interface:
		+groups
		+layouts
		+controls
		+shapes
	-this collection of objects are called "nodes"
	-all nodes are derivations of the Node class

In JavaFX, layout
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
In Swing, a lout is assoicated with a JPanel.  The top-level
JPanel gives the basica layout for the frame.  Nesting additional
layouts within the top-level layout, you must create addtional JPanels,
set their associated layouts, and then add then to the higher-level Layout.


In JavaFX...layouts are extentions of the Node class just as 
the UI components are.  Layouts contain a collection of
