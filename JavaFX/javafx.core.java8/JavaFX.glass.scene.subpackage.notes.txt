JavaFX Scene Package
===========================
16 Core Java 8 Classes
----------------------------
package javafx.scene contains 16 powerful
JavaFX  Java 8 classes:

  Camera
  ParallelCamera
  PerspectiveCamera
  Cursor
  ImageCursor
  LightBase
  PointLight
  AmbientLight
  Scene Grappd


The Java 8 javafx.scene Package
------------------------------------------
Scene Graph   Light & Camera    Scene Utilities
+++++++++++   ++++++++++++++    +++++++++++++++
Scene         Cursor            SnapshotResult
Node          ImageCursor       SnapshotParameters
Parent        LightBase         SceneAntialiasing
Group         PointLight
SubScene      AmbientLight
              Camera
              ParallelCamera


Primary classes of javafx.scene package
============================================
Primary classes in javafx.scene:
  javafx.scene.Scene
  javafx.scene.Node
In a sense the Node class and all of its subclasses
may be viewed as being below the Scene class...despite
the Node class not being a subclass of the Scene class...as opposed
to the Node(Scene Graph) class and subclasses are contained
inside the Scene object itself(composistion).


Scene Constructor
=========================
It's overloaded:

Scene(Parent root)
Scene(Parent root, double width, double height)
Scene(Parent root, double width, double height, boolean depthBuffer)
Scene(Parent root, double width, double height, boolean depthBuffer, SceneAntialiasing aAlias)
Scene(Parent root, double width, double height, Paint fill)
Scene(Pareent root, Paint fill)



JavaFX Scene Graph: Organizing Scenes, Using Parent Nodes
============================================================
A scene graph, whihc isnot usnique to JavaFX and which can
be seen in quite a few new media content creation 
software packages,  with the root node at the top and 
branch nodes and leaf nodes comming off the root node.

JavaFX Scene Graph data structure alows you not only 
to architect, organize, and design your JavaFX scene and its content,
but also to apply:
  opacity
  states
  event handlers
  transformations
  special effects
to entire logical branches of the Scene Graph hierarchy if you
set up the Scene Graph correctly

Figure below depicts a Scene Graph tree, with the root node
at the top and branch and leaf nodes below it:


Scene Object (Contains Scene Graph Node Hierarchy)
----------------------------------------------------
                ROOT NODE
[*******************************************]
        |             |
    [Branch Node]    [leaf node]
    |           |
  [leaf Node] [leaf Node]

Branch nodes are decendents of:
    
    javafx.scene.Parent

...and as a type of "Parent"

Branch nodes may have other Branches or leaf nodes as children
Leaf nodes cannot have children
Branch nodes maybe created by using the following classes:

*Parent
*Group
*SubScene

Or the subclasses of the above:

*WebView
*PopupControl
*Region
*Pane
*StackPane

Leaf Nodes maybe be:

JavaFX objects

that may be configured using parameters
such as shapes, text, or an ImageView
Leaf Nodes are therefore always contain a JavaFX
class that has not been subclassed(extended) from the
Parent class, and that has not itself been specifically
desinged to have child elements(child objects) within
it, or below it.
