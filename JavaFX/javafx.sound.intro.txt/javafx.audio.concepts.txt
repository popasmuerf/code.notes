Digital Audio concepts: Amplitude, Frequency, Samples
======================================================
Digital audio is complex.  Part of the that complexity involves 
bridging analog audio technology, created with speaker cones, with digital
audio codecs.


Sound waves and requency
======================================================
Sound waves generate various tones, depending on the frequency of the 
sound wave.  A wide, or infrequent(long), wave produces
a low(bass) tone, whereas frequent (short) wavlengths produce
high frequency sounds.


Volume of sound
=======================================================
The volume of a sound wave will be determined by its amplitude,
or "height" of it's wave.  The frequency of a sound wave equates
to how closely together the waves are spaced, along the x-axis
and the amplitude are measured along the y-axis


Shape of a sound wave
=======================================================
Sound waves can be uniquely shaped, allowing them to "piggyback"
varous sound effets.  A "pure" or baseline, type of sound wave is called a 
"sine wave", which is the same sine-wave you learned about in trigonometry.

Even randomoized waveforms, such as noise, are used in sound design to obtain edgy sound
results.  As you may have ascertained by usig your recently acquired knowledge of data footprint
optimization, the more "chaos", or noise, present in your sound wave(and in new media data in general)
the harder it will be to compress for a codec.  therefore, more complex sound waves will result in larger digital
audio file sizes, owing to the chaso in the data


Converting  Analogy Audio to Digital Audio Data: Sampling, Accuracy, HD Audio
==============================================================================
The process of turing analog audio(soundwaves) into digital audio data is called
"sampling".  Devices that perform this in the music industry are called "Samplers".
Sampling involves the process of slicing an analog audio wave into segments so that yu can store the shape
of the wave as digital audio data, that is, into zeroes and ones(0's -and- 1's) using a digital audio
format.  This turns an infinitely accurate analog sound wave into a discrete amount of digital data.
Each digital segment of a sampled audio sound wae is called a sample, becaus it samples that sound  wave
at an exact opoint in time.  The "Sample Accuracy"(resolution) you want will determine the level o percision
of a sample.  

NOTE:  Media Percision
=======================
Audio : determined by the amount of data used to define each wave slice's height/amplitude
Image/Video : determined by the amount of data used to define the image/video resolution

Both (image resolution/sample resolution) are both measured in values of : 8bit, 12bit, 16bit, 24bit,32bit


How games leverage sample resolution
=======================
	*	explosions = 8 bit....no need for that much clarity

	*	speech	=	12 bit.....provides very clear sound for speech.  This is the reason why voices sounded 	terrible back in the height of the 8-bit console era

	*	background music = possible 16 bit....though 12 bit resolution will usually suffice

	*	Essenstially the more data used for sampling...the better the resolution.

	*	There is a reason why CD-Audio(16-bit audio) was once such a big deal....and why HD audio is now.

	*	Modern game conoles have hardware capable of 24-bit audio.  Awesome....

	*	For our game.....HD audio is probably a bit overboard...unless we are writing a sound-based game....
