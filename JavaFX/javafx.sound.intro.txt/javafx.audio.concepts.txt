Digital Audio concepts: Amplitude, Frequency, Samples
======================================================
Digital audio is complex.  Part of the that complexity involves 
bridging analog audio technology, created with speaker cones, with digital
audio codecs.


Sound waves and requency
======================================================
Sound waves generate various tones, depending on the frequency of the 
sound wave.  A wide, or infrequent(long), wave produces
a low(bass) tone, whereas frequent (short) wavlengths produce
high frequency sounds.


Volume of sound
=======================================================
The volume of a sound wave will be determined by its amplitude,
or "height" of it's wave.  The frequency of a sound wave equates
to how closely together the waves are spaced, along the x-axis
and the amplitude are measured along the y-axis


Shape of a sound wave
=======================================================
Sound waves can be uniquely shaped, allowing them to "piggyback"
varous sound effets.  A "pure" or baseline, type of sound wave is called a 
"sine wave", which is the same sine-wave you learned about in trigonometry.

Even randomoized waveforms, such as noise, are used in sound design to obtain edgy sound
results.  As you may have ascertained by usig your recently acquired knowledge of data footprint
optimization, the more "chaos", or noise, present in your sound wave(and in new media data in general)
the harder it will be to compress for a codec.  therefore, more complex sound waves will result in larger digital
audio file sizes, owing to the chaso in the data
