Digital Imaging Concepts: Resolution, Color Depth, Alpha, Layers
=================================================================
All the concepts regarding image resolution applies to digital
video and animation.  Video and animation ultimately consist of individual
frames.   24 frames/sec is enough to provide an illusion of motion. 
Animations and Video are essentially the swaping of digitial images.
This should be taken into consideration w/r to memory footprints.
Not only must you be conscerned with the the memory footprint of each
indidvidual image required for the animation...and the resources required
to load and swap each image with such speed that it appears to be
be an animation in motion.

Note:
==============
If we were to use 900KB images for a 5 frame animation...that would require
a memory resource dedicated to this anmiation of 900KB * 5 = 4,500 MB.  We can reduce the 
allocation of system memory by using static background images and only drawing exactly what we
need on to it....thus reducting the size of each individual frame.



Digital Image Resolution and Aspect Ratio: Defining Image Size and Shape:
=========================================================================
Digital imagery is made up of 2D(two-dimensional) arrays of pixels
(pixel stands for picture[pix]
 element[el]]).  The sharpmess of an image
 is expressed by its resolution, which is the number of pixels in the image
 width and height.
 	w = x-axis
 	h = y-axis

The more pixels an image has, the higher its resolution.  This is similar to how
digital cameras work, as the more megapixels in aimage capture device
(a camera CDD), the higher the image quality tha can be achieved....


How to find the total number of image pixels
========================================================================
To find the total number of image pixels, multiple the swidth pixels  by
the height pixels:
	w*h = total number of image pixels

Example:
************************************************************
A wide video graphics array (VGA) 800 * 480 image contains:
	384,000 pixels
which is 3/8 of a megabyte.  This is how you would fid the size of yoru image,
both in terms of kilobytes(or megabytes) and the height and width of it displayed on
the screen.


Aspect ration
*************************************************************
An aspect ratio of a retangle(of matching sides) would be irrelvant of the actual width and height:

	1:1 | 3:3 | 100:100 == 1:1

An aspect ration of a rectangle  where w=8 && h=12  has a ratio of  8/12  == 2/3  == 2:3



Color theory
====================================================================================================
The color values for each digital image pixel can be deined by the
amount of three different colors:

	red, green, and blue (RGP)

which are present in different amounts in every pixel.  Consumer electronics display screens
leverage additive colors, in which wavelength sof light for each RGB channel are added
together creating 16.8 milion different color values.  Additvie color is used
in liquid crystal display (LCD), light-emitting diode(LED), and organic lightemitting
diode(OED) displays.

256 levels of brightness for each read, green, and blue color value that is held for each
pixel...this allows for  8bits of velue-controlling color brightness variation
for each fo teh red, green, and blue values, from a minimum of :

	0(#00, or offf, all dark or black)  --> 255(#FF, or fully on, macismum color contributed)

color depths often used in digital imaging industry include:
	8 bit 256 colors
	16 bit 65,536 colors
	24 bit 16,777,216 colors
	32 bit 32,000,000
^^^ All of these use GIF and PNG8 formats to hold this indexed color type
of data.

Note: Formats aside from GIF, JPEG, PNG
=============================
If you want to use fomats like TIFF, or TGA in your JavaFX
projects, then import a 3rd Party ImageJ library. 


Digital Image Composisting: Using Alpha Channels and Transparency in Layers
=============================================================================

What is compositing?
****************************************************
Compositing is the process of seamlessly blending together multiple layers
of digital imagery.  As you might imagine, this is an extremely important concept
for game design and development.

Where is compositing used ?
*****************************************************
Compositing is useful when you want to create an image
on the display that appears as though it is one single image(or animation),
when i is actually the seamless collection of two or more composited image layers.
One of the principle reasons you would want to set up an image or animation
composite is to allow programmatic control over various elements in those images,
by having them on different layers.

How do we accomplish composition ?
*******************************************************
To accomplish this, you  need to have an:

 alpha channel transparency

value, which you can use to control the precision of the blending amount of a given pixel
with another pixel(meaning in the same x,y image location)

Like the other RGB channels, an alpha channel has 256 transparency levels.
In Java programming the alpha channel is represented by the first two slots in
a hexadecimal representation of 

	#AARRGGBB

data values.  Alpha channel ARGB data values use eight slots(32 bit) of
data rather than the six data slots used in 24-bit image, which is really
a 32-bit image with zero alpha channel data.

Dithering
=======================================
Dither is an intentionally applied form of noice used to randomize quantization error, preventing
large-scale patterns such as color banding in images.  Dithering is also used
in digital audio and video data.

colour banding is a problem of inaccurate colour presentation in computer graphics.  Banding is most apparent
in 8-bit gradients where where dithering is not an option.

Dithering will always increase the data footprint by a few percentage points...and as such will increase
the resultant file size.
