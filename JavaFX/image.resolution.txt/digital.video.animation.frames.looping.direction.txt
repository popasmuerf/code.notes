Digital Imaging Concepts: Resolution, Color Depth, Alpha, Layers
=================================================================
All the concepts regarding image resolution applies to digital
video and animation.  Video and animation ultimately consist of individual
frames.   24 frames/sec is enough to provide an illusion of motion. 
Animations and Video are essentially the swaping of digitial images.
This should be taken into consideration w/r to memory footprints.
Not only must you be conscerned with the the memory footprint of each
indidvidual image required for the animation...and the resources required
to load and swap each image with such speed that it appears to be
be an animation in motion.

Note:
==============
If we were to use 900KB images for a 5 frame animation...that would require
a memory resource dedicated to this anmiation of 900KB * 5 = 4,500 MB.  We can reduce the 
allocation of system memory by using static background images and only drawing exactly what we
need on to it....thus reducting the size of each individual frame.

Digital video you must take into account that you not only must take into account the total size
of each frame...but the number of seconds the video will play


We can reduce the total amount of space used by animations and video by using efficienct codes(codecs/decode)


Codec used by JavaFX, HTML5, and Android(a most efficinet codec)
===================================================================
MPEG-4 H.264 AVC.
Not only is it ver efficienct...but we can also use it accross platforms.



Digital Video Compression Concepts: Bit Rate, Data Streaming, SD, HD, UHD
===========================================================================

Primary standard resolutiosn that are used for commerical video are also commonly
used for device screen resolutions....this allows for easy screen resolution
matches and that do not require scaling and thus avoids scaling artifacts:

*	Standard definition(SD) : 480px (vertical)
*	VGA(a form of "wide" SD)		: 720 x 480
*	High Definition(psuedo HD)	:1280 * 720
*	High Definition(true  HD 16:9)	:1280 * 1080
*	High Definition(true  HD ratio 16:9)	:1280 * 1080
*	High Definition(true  HD ratio 16:9)	:1280 * 1080  //used in TVs mobile devices, game consoles
*   Ultra High Definition(UHD)	:4096 x 2160

Data Streaming is more complicated concept than resolution, as it involves playing back
video data over some medium from a remote location.  Streaming is supported by
the codec(encoder-decoder pair):

	MPEG-4 H.264 AVC

Bit-rate
==========================================================================
Bit rate is the key setting used in the video compresion process.
Bit rates represent your target bandwidth, or the data pipe size that is able to
accomomdate a certain number of bits streaming through it every second.  Bit rates
should always take into account cpu processing power and bus bandwidths.  Single corew
CPUs may not be able to decode high-resolution, high-bit rate digital video assets without
dropping frames, so do make sure to optimize low-bit rate video assets
if you are going to target older or less expensive consumer electronic devices




Closed and Open source compression/streaming codecs worth mentioning
=========================================================================
*	Sorenson Squeeze Pro
*	Editshare Light Works


Like image compression and resolution, video/animation needs optimization
========================================================================
*	Each frame of the video is where initial optimizaton takes place
	-If we are using 800 x 480 or 1280 x 720 smartphones, e-readers, etc then
	we do not need to use true HD to get good visuals for our visual assets
	-With superfine density(small dot pitch) displays, we can scala a 1280 video up 33 percent
	while looking reasonably good
*	Frames per second(FPS)..
	-always try to shorten the number of seconds
	-always try to reduce the the number of frames per second

Example:
************************************************************
A wide video graphics array (VGA) 800 * 480 image contains:
	384,000 pixels
which is 3/8 of a megabyte.  This is how you would fid the size of yoru image,
both in terms of kilobytes(or megabytes) and the height and width of it displayed on
the screen.


Aspect ration
*************************************************************
An aspect ratio of a retangle(of matching sides) would be irrelvant of the actual width and height:

	1:1 | 3:3 | 100:100 == 1:1

An aspect ration of a rectangle  where w=8 && h=12  has a ratio of  8/12  == 2/3  == 2:3
