JavaFX Scene Builder:  Using FXML for UI Design
======================================================
JavaFX Scene Builder is a visual design tool that generates an FXML
(JavaFX markup language). The UI JavaFX definition are inflated
in Java 8 to crate your application's JavaFX scene Graph, nodes, groups
and SubScene objects  filled with package:

	javafx.scene.contol

Because FXML and Sene Builder are optimized for UI design:

	*	buttons
	*	check boxes
	*	text fields
	*	etc


^^^ Because of what what our scene builder was designed for....
You generally don't use scene builders in general 
for building dynamic UIs

We will use some features of it....for things like menus and score
boards....but most of our UI code will be programmitic.




To use FXML 
======================================================
To use FXML, and soon adter use the Scene Build visual UI design tool,
you must create a special kind of FXML application, as you
learned previously.  Creating an FXML application imports the javafx.fxml
package and classes.  This allows the Java 8 code to inflate FXML constructs created by
the UI designers so that they can be used by the programmers 
to attch Java logic to the various UI controls.  The Android OS does this well, 
using basic XML, but in Anddrod, this approach is not optional; it is part of the
way things are done. More about Android UI can be explored in books like "Pro Android UI"

The Scene Builder visual layout tool that writes FXML UI design contructs for you is 
WYSIWYG drag and drop interface design.

We can also apply all CSS styels to the Scene Buider tool and FXML structure in real time and see the results of those coding changes as well, again, withoug ANY Java compliation.

Note:  The Scene builder kit API is 100% open source.

3D is fully suported in the scened builder, though it is not yet possible to build
3D objects using Scene Builder.  Further work integrating this tool with OpenGL3D
will likely change this.



FXML Definition: Anatomy of an XML UI Definition Construct
===========================================================
FXML structure is based on teh JavaFX classes(objects), and their attributes,
that the FXML tags, and praameters structures, which you can easily create,
allow you to "mock up" a front-end UI more easily, using a mark-up language.  The FXML
structure lets you more easily construct your Scene Graph hierarchy, and the FXML
tags and their parameters, which you will be looking at in the next section, match
up 1:1 with JavaFX API classes.
=======================================================
The volume of a sound wave will be determined by its amplitude,
or "height" of it's wave.  The frequency of a sound wave equates
to how closely together the waves are spaced, along the x-axis
and the amplitude are measured along the y-axis



HelloWorld  UI FXML Definition: Replication Your Current UI Design, Using FXML
==================================================================================
The first thing that you define in the FXML structure is the FXML processing instructions.

<? xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<? import java.lang.* ?>
<? import javas.lang.* ?>
<? import javafx.scene.* ?>
<? import javafx.scene.layout.* ?>
<? import javafx.scene.control.* ?>
<StackPain id="root" preHeight="250" prefWidth="300" >
	<children>
		<Button id="btn" text = "Say 'Hello World'" layoutX="125" layoutY="116"/>
	</children>
</StackPane>




Shape of a sound wave
=======================================================
Sound waves can be uniquely shaped, allowing them to "piggyback"
varous sound effets.  A "pure" or baseline, type of sound wave is called a 
"sine wave", which is the same sine-wave you learned about in trigonometry.

Even randomoized waveforms, such as noise, are used in sound design to obtain edgy sound
results.  As you may have ascertained by usig your recently acquired knowledge of data footprint
optimization, the more "chaos", or noise, present in your sound wave(and in new media data in general)
the harder it will be to compress for a codec.  therefore, more complex sound waves will result in larger digital
audio file sizes, owing to the chaso in the data


Converting  Analogy Audio to Digital Audio Data: Sampling, Accuracy, HD Audio
==============================================================================
The process of turing analog audio(soundwaves) into digital audio data is called
"sampling".  Devices that perform this in the music industry are called "Samplers".
Sampling involves the process of slicing an analog audio wave into segments so that yu can store the shape
of the wave as digital audio data, that is, into zeroes and ones(0's -and- 1's) using a digital audio
format.  This turns an infinitely accurate analog sound wave into a discrete amount of digital data.
Each digital segment of a sampled audio sound wae is called a sample, becaus it samples that sound  wave
at an exact opoint in time.  The "Sample Accuracy"(resolution) you want will determine the level o percision
of a sample.  

NOTE:  Media Percision
=======================
Audio : determined by the amount of data used to define each wave slice's height/amplitude
Image/Video : determined by the amount of data used to define the image/video resolution

Both (image resolution/sample resolution) are both measured in values of : 8bit, 12bit, 16bit, 24bit,32bit


How games leverage sample resolution
=======================
	*	explosions = 8 bit....no need for that much clarity

	*	speech	=	12 bit.....provides very clear sound for speech.  This is the reason why voices sounded 	terrible back in the height of the 8-bit console era

	*	background music = possible 16 bit....though 12 bit resolution will usually suffice

	*	Essenstially the more data used for sampling...the better the resolution.

	*	There is a reason why CD-Audio(16-bit audio) was once such a big deal....and why HD audio is now.

	*	Modern game conoles have hardware capable of 24-bit audio.  Awesome....

	*	For our game.....HD audio is probably a bit overboard...unless we are writing a sound-based game....


Sampling Frequency
=======================================
AKA as the "sampling rate".  This is a measure of how many smaples
at particular sample resolution are taken during 1 second of sampling time frame.
In terms of digital image editing, samplking frequency is analougous to the number of colors
contained in a digital image.  For example:
	
	CD-quality audio = 16-bit 44.1 kHz sampling rate
	------------------------------------------------
	44.1 thousand samples per second with 16-bit sample resolution

Calculating the raw data of an audio file
========================================
(sampling bit rate) * (number of seconds in the sample)


Most common audio sampling rates
====================================
	*	8 kHz
	*	22 kHz
	*	32 kHz
	*	44.1 kHz
	*	48 kHz
	*	96 kHz
	*	192 kHz
	*	384 kHz

8 kHz, 11kHz, 22 kHz, are the ones that we are going to use
in our games, as with careful optimization, these can yield high-quality
sound effects and arcade music.  These rates would be optimal for samplin any voic-based
digital audio as well, such as movie dialogue or an e-book narration track.
Higer rates like 44.1 kHz is appropiate for music, high-fidelity stuff like rumbling
thunder, THX quality audio, etc....

Bit rates are defined during the compresssion process
=======================================================
Digital audio files that need to support lower bit-rate bandwidth are going to have
more compression applied to the audio data, which results in lower aquality.
these will steam(play black) more smoothly accross a greater number of devices,



Digital Audio in JavaFX: Supported Digital Audio Codecs and Data Formats
===================================================================
There are considerably mor digital audio codecs in JavaFX than digital
video codecs, as there is only one video codec, MPEG-4 H.264 AVC.

-----------------------------------
Platform	|	Supported Codecs
----------------------------------
JavaFX		|	.mpeg-4 H.264 AVC
			|	.mp3
----------------------------------
Android     |   .mp3
			|	wave
			|	.mp4(.mp4-a)
			|	.mpeg-4 aac
			|	.aiff(pcm)
			|	
-----------------------------------

^^^ mpg is a lossy audio file format.  If you use mp3...make sure you 
get the most out of it.

Wave is one of the origional audio formats used with the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft
Windows OSs, respectivey.  These wave files use PCM(pulse code modulation) audio which is loseless(if there is no compression applied)   PCM is commonly used for DC-ROM contents as well as telephony 
applications.  With no compression PCM becomes relatively much less CPU-intensive as no compression/decompression algorithms need be ran during streaming. 

For this reason...PCM should be your basline file format. It allows you to review the
differences between wave, mp3, mp4, etc file formats and their compression results.



Digital Audio optimization: Start with CD-Quality Audio, and Work Backward
============================================================================
JavaFX also supports the popular MPEG-4 AAC codec.  These digital audio data can be contained in 
MPEG4 contanters (.mp4,.m4a,.m4v), or file extensions, and can be played back using any Operating System.

Note: JavaFX does not contain an MPEG-4 decoder...it useds the OS's MPEG-4 decoder
