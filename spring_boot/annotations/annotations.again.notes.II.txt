Difference between @Bean -and- @Component


Spring stereoytps and how to use them.


@Bean:
	In spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application
	and that are managed by the Spring IoC are called beans.  A bean
	is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise
	managed by a Spring IoC container


@Component:
	Indicates that an annotated class is a "component"

@Controller:
	Indicates that an annotated class is a "Service",
	originally defined by Domain-Driven Design(Evans, 2003)
	as "an operation offered as an interface that stands
	alone in the model, with no encapsulated state"


@Reposiotry:
	Indicates that an annotated class is a "Repository", originally
	defined by Domain-Driven as "a mechanism for encapsulatiing storage,
	retreival, and search behavior which emulates a collection of objects".
