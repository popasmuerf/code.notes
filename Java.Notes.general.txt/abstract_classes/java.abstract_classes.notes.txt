Abstract Classes Compared to interfaces:
==================================================
Abstract classes are similar to interfaces.  You cannot
instansiate them, and they may conatin a mix of methods
declared with or without an implementation.  However with
abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not
static and final, and define  public, protected, and private
concrete methods.  With interfaces, all fields are automatically 
public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare
are public.  In addition, you may only extend one class...
as with interfaces...you may implement as many as you like...


Which should you use, abstract classes or interfaces ?
======================================================
	*	Consider using abstract classes
		if any of these statements apply
		to your situation:
		-	You wish to share code among
			several closely related classes
		-	You want to declare non-static or
			non-final fields, or require
			access modifiers other than public
		-	You want to declare non-static or non-final
			fields.  This enables you to define methods
			that can access and modify the state of the
			object to which they belong

	*	Consider using interfaces
		if any of these statements apply
		to your situation:
		-	You expect unrelated classes would implement
			your interface.  For example, the interfaces
			Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by
			many unrelated classes
		-	You want to specify the behavior of a particual
			data type, but not concerned about who
			implements its behavior
		-	You want to take advantage of multiple 				inheritance of a type


Example
-----------------------------------
In writing a video game..and designing NPCs including
enemies....I likely would want to have the base friendly and 
base unfriendly NPCs defined in two seperate abstract classes,
...which in turn will serve as progenators for all resultant
NPC classes...that will implement varous interfaces which will
allow for more varied behaviors according to their type of NPC.
