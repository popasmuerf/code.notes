Karen Meese Pyles here is a quick list of the stupid, vile
acts that conservatives are currently responsible for...
Here is 
1. The Southern Strategy where conservatives purposely
scapegoat and demonize people of color for poltical
gain.
2. The never ending attempt to punish poor people for being
poor
3. Trying their best to disenfranchise people for the crime
of not voting conservative
4. The never ending attempts to destroy public education
5. The never ending attempts to destroy public healthcare
and prevent what pathetic semblance we have to public healthcare from the rest of the populace
6. The never ending attempts at trying to destroy agencies
   that keep our water, air, and food taint free
7. Hair-Brained economic plans that  always end in disaster
   for everyone but the rich
8. The criminal invasion of other soverign nations for the sole purpose of stealing their resources ending in the deaths
of innocent people and the near total annihilation of 
said sovering nations


I could go on....we can play this game all day.
