What is Machine Learning ?
================================
Machien learning is a branch of science that deals with programming the systems in such
a way that they automatically learn and imporve with experience.
Here, learning means recognizing and understanding the input data and making
wise decisions based on the supplied data.

It is very difficlut to cater to all the decissions based on all possible inputs.
To tackle this problem, algorithms are developed.  These algorithms build knowledge from
specific data and past experience with the principles of statistics, probability theory, logic, conbinatorial optimizaton,
search reinforcement learning, and control learning.


Extent developed algorithms form the basis of varioius applications such as:
=============================================================================


	*	Vision processing
	*	Language processing
	*	Forecasting(e.g., staock market trends)
	*	Pattern recognition
	*	Games
	*	Data minining
	*	Expert Systems
	*	Robots


Machine Learning is a vast discipline...
============================================================================
Let's concentrate on :
	*	Supervised learning
	*	Unsupervised Learning


Suervised Learning: examples of  where it is appropiate
=========================================================
	* 	classifying e-mails as spam
	*	self-organizing maps
	*	heirachical clustering
	*	recomondations (Amazon, Google ads for things you may be interested in)
