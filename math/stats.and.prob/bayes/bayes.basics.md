# What is "Bayesian" Statistics ?



Frequentist statistics is founded on the idea that probability represents the 
frequency with witch something happens.

If the probsbility of getting heads in a single conin toss is
0.5, that means after a single coin toss we can expect to get one-half
of a head of a coin (with two tosses we can expect to ge one head,
which makes more sense)



Byesian statistics, on the other hand, is concerned with
how probabilities represent how uncertain we are
about a piece of information.

In Bayesian terms, if the probability of getting heads in a coin toss
is 0.5, that means we are equally unsure about whether we will 
get heads or tails.  For problems like conin tosses, both requentist and Bayesian approaches
seem reeaonsble, buth when you are quantifying your belief that your favorite candidiate will win the next election
candidate will win the next eletion, the Bayesian interpretation makes more sense.

When doing Bayesian statitiscs, we are just rtying to accurately describe what we beleive about the world given the inforamtion we have.


ONe particularly nice thing about Byesian statistics is that, because we can view it simply as 
reasoning about uncertain things, all of the tools and techniques of 
of bayesian statistics make intuitive sense.


Bayesian statitistics is about looking at a problem you face, figuring
out how you want to describe it mathematically, and then using 
reason to solve it.



## Reasoning About Strange Experiences

One night you are suddenly awakened by a bright light at your
window.  You jump up from bed and look out to see
a large object in the sky that can only be described as saucer shaped.
Yu are generally a skeptic and have never beleived in alien encounters, but, 
comnpletely prepelexed by the scene outside, you find yourself thinking,
Could this be a UFO ?!?


1. Observed data
2. Formed hypothesis
3. Updated your beleifs based on the data


This reasoning tends to happen so quickoy that you don't 
have anytime to analyze your own thinking.  You created a 
new belief without questionint it: whereas before you did
not beliee in the exitence of UFOs, after the vent you have updated your beliefes

### Observing DAta

Founding your beliefs on data is a ke component of
Bayesian reasoning.  Before you can draw any 
conclusions about the sene(such as claiming what you 
see is a UFO), you need the data you are boserving, in this case:

- An extremely bright light outside your window
- A saucer-shaped objet hovering in the air 


Based on your past experience, you would desdcribe what you
saw out your window as "surpising".  In probabilistic terms, we could write this as:

(bright light outside window, sourcher-shaped object in sky) = P(UFO)

So based on prior experience :

	P(UFO) = "pretty damn unlikely"


P(UFO_alpha | UFO)  =  P(UFO) * P(UFO | UFO_alpha)

1. jumpsec01/2RDP -->  pente01
2. pente01 is slow
3. open broswer 
4. FF Lincene and Infrastructure Manager (get the password from Sridevi)
5. Activity -->  see who is currently logged in.
6. Check with whoever is logged in
7. If you need to Rrelease all licenses to bounce them off...then do that.
8. minimize pente03
9. RDP --> pente02
10. You need to have a #account
11. Webinspect(run as admin)
12. Open broswer and check target URLs (login urls are done differently)
13. prod urls must be scanned off hours 
14. Go back to tool(ignore the license exceptions)
15. Start a GudiedScan or API Scan
16. If the URLs are legit and running  and you have any required URL credentials, etc......
17. for this tutorial...basic scan
18.  Web Site Scan
	- scan name
	- Crawl/Crawl & Audit 
	- Standard Scan
	- Start URL
	- Next
	- Network Proxy - auto dectect
	- If there is a network login then provided Centrify credentials
	- Site Authentication - provide credentials - set macro recording
	- Next
19 Coverage and Thouroughness
	- Framew work ? if so then see if it is listed and selecty
	- Crawl Coverage leave default
	- Audit Depth (Policy) - Standard
	- Next
20. Settings
	- Discovery - check
	- Passive Analysis Keyword - check
	- Form Values - leave Auto fill web forms during crawl only in enviroments lower than "staging"
	- Add Allowed Hosts: 
		Profiler Discovered -- leave this alone
		Allowed Hosts -- leave this alone
	- save settings
	- scan

21. Scan 

23. WebInsspect dashboard 
	- scan will start....
	- scan completes
	- The findings will be apparent in the dash
	- Righ click and export all items into CSV and dump into local folder -- E:\userid-Webinspect
	- run audit
	-

24.4 Get Reporting document from Sridevi


25. There is a web pentesting checklist (get from Sridevi)
	- run through the checklist
	- all attempts at logging in should be done last for obvious reasons(locked out)
