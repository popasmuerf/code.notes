# 1. Bayes Theorem of Conditional Probability

Before we die into Baytes theorem, let's review 
- marginal
- joint
- conditional probability


If the random variable is independent, then it is the 
probabilitty of the event direclty, otherwise, if the 
variable is depedent upon other variables, the the marginal prbability
is the probability of the event summed over all
outcomes for the dependent vartiable,s called the  **sum rule**


***Marginal Probability**:

The probability of an event
irrespective of the outcomes of other random 
variables is indepent variables, e.g P(A)


The joint probability is the probability of two (or more)
simultanteous events, often described in terms events
A and B from two dependent random variables, ,
e.g X and Y.  The joint probability is often
summarized as jsut the outcomes, e.g. A and B 


****Joint Probability****

The joint probability isthe probability of two (or more) simultaneous
events, often described in terms of
events A and B from two dependent random variables,
e.g. X and Y. The joint probability is often summarized
as just the outcomes, e,g.  A and B.


Joint Probability :
	Probability of two (or more) simultaneous events 
	e.g. 

	P(A & B) or P(A,B)


 ****Conditional Probability****
Probaiblity of one (or more) event given the 
occurence of another event, e.g. 
P(A given B) or P(A|B)


###### Conditional Probability:
Probability of one (or more) event
given the occurence of another event, e.g
// P(A) given P(B)

P(A given B) or P(A | B)


##### Joint Probability : 
Calculated via using the conditional probability ;

P(A,B) = P(A|B) * P(B)


#### Product rule
Importantly, th ejoint 
probability is symmetrical, meanting that:

P(A,B) = P(B,A)  //makes sense if order of occurance doesn't matter
