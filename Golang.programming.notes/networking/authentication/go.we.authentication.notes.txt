Cookie-Based Authentication
======================================
A cookie-based approach is the most widley
used method of implementing authentication
into web applications.  In this
approach, HTTP cookies are used to 
authenticate users on every HTTP
request after they have
logged in to the system with user
credentials.

Cookie based authentication systems are good
for traditional web apps that are mostly server
side...but not for web apis that should be stateless
or for cross site authentication.

Token-Based Authentication
=======================================================
Methods of developing has changed a bit in the past
few years..The era of mobile application 
development has also changed the way 
web-based systems are developed has also
changed the way web-based systems are developed.
Modern web deveolpment is moving towards
an API-driven approach in which a web API (often than
not is RESTful) is porovided on the server side, and weeb
applications and mobile applications are 
built by consuming the web API.


Token based approach
=====================================
A token-based approach is a modern approach for
implementing authentication into
web applications and web APIs.  

	*	access token ID used for 
		authentication on every HTTP request
	*	usernames and passwords to log
		into the system may also be used
		via token-based authentication
	*	users allowed access to the system
		the authenticating system generates an
		access token for the subsequent
		HTTP rquets to get
		authentication into the web server.
	*	Typically, the access tokens
		are sent with an HTTP
		Authorization header as a bearer
		token that can be validated
		at the web server

Token based authentication Process:
=========================================
1.	Authenticate into the system by provding a username
	and poassword, or by providing a client ID
	and a secret key

2.	If auth request is successful, the authentication
	system generates a securely signed string as
	an access token for subsequent HTTP rquests

3.	The client application recieves the token from the
	web server and uses it to access web server
	resources.

4.	The client application provides the access
	token on every HTTP rquest into the web
	server.  An HTTP header is
	used to transmit the access token into
	the web server.


5. The web server validates the access token provided by
the client application and then provides the web server
resources if the access token is valid



A token based approace is very convenient when you 
build mobile applicatons for which you 
don't need to leverage cookies on the client.
when you use APIS as your server side implmentation,
uou don't need to maintiain session stores that alow you 
to build stateless APIs on the server side.
Token based authentication is actually a derivative
of OAuth 2




OAuth 2
===============================================
OAuth 2 is an open specification.  The OAuth 2.0
authorization framework enables a 
third-party application to obtain limited
access to an HTTP service such as
FB, Twitter, GitHub, and Google.  The
most important thing is that 
OAuth 2 is a specification for authentication flow.

	*	OAuth 2 provides the authorization flow for
		-	web apps
		-	desktop apps
		-	mobile applications.
	*	Allows for delegations of
		identity and user authorization
		to social identity providers

	*	When you register your app
		into an identity provider to authorize the 
		application to acccess the user 
		acount.
	*	registering your app into the identity
		provider, typically it gives ou a client ID
		and a client secret key to obtain access
		to the user account of th identity provider

	*	Once logged into the ID provider using the 
		client ID and client secret key, the
		authentication server gives you access
		token that can be used for accessing protected
		resources of teh web server.


Authentication with OAuth using the Goth Package
=====================================================
1. Bullshit....you don't need 50 years of intense study
to figure out that doing demonstrably stupid shit that
ALWAYS ends in disaster is a FAIL

2. Are you seriously suggesting that:
	1. Placing literal fucking Nazis in the White House
	2. Making it easier for corporations to further destroy
	   our enviroment that we kind of need to live.
	3. Literally stealing from the working class and poor
	   to give even more money to people whom already have
	   it...just because

	4. Starting shit with N.Korea and doing his best to
	   destabilize the Mid-East even further than it has
	   been since the assasination of Rabin

	5. Actually
