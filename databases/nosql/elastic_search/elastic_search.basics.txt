Elastic Search basics
===================================
ES is a real-time distributed and open source full-text search and analytics engine.  It is used in Single Page Application (SPA) projects.


Elastic Search is based on Lucene


Prereuisites
============================
Basic understanding of Java, JSON,
search engines, and understanding
of RESTful APIs


General Features
================================
The general features of Elasticsearch as follows

	*	ES can be used as a
		replacement of a document
		stores like MongoDB and RavenDB
	*	ES is on eof the popular
		enterprise search engines
		and is being currently
		used by Wikipedia, The Guardian, Stack Overflow
		, GitHub etc
	*	Elastic search is open source
		and available under the 
		Apache licence


ES Key Concepts
===================================
	*	Node:
	-------------------------------
	It refers to a single running
	instance of ES .  Single physical
	and virtual server accomodates 
	multiple nodes depending upon
	the capabilities of their physical resources.

		*	Cluster:
	-------------------------------
	It is a collection of one or more
	nodes.  Cluster provides a
	collective indexing and search
	capabilities across all the
	nodes for entire data

	*	Index:
	-------------------------------
	It is a collection of different
	type of documents and document
	properties.  Index also uses
	the concept of shards to improve
	the performance.  For example
	, a set of document contains 
	data of a social networking
	application

	*	Type Mapping:
	-------------------------------
	It is a collection of documents 
	sharing a set of common fields
	present in the same index.  For example, an index contains data
	of a social networking application, and then there can be a specific type for user profile data, another type for messaging data, and another for
	comments data.


	*	Document:
	-------------------------------
	It is a collection of fields in
	a specific manner defined in JSON
	format.  Every document belongs to
	a type and resides inside an index.
	Every dofcument is associated with a unique identifier, known as a UID


	*	Shard:
	-------------------------------
	Indexes are horizontally
	subdivided into shards.  Each
	shard of course then contains
	all the properties of 
	a document, but contains
	less number of JSON objects
	than an index.  Horizontal
	sharding makes a shard an
	independent node, which cna
	be stored in any node

ES Advantages
===================================
	*	Written in Java...write once, run anywhere there is a 
	compliant jvm
	------------------------------

	*	Real time, the moment a document is added it is searchable in the system:
	-------------------------------

	*	Distributed, which makes it
	easy to scale, and fault tolerant:
	-------------------------------

	*	Creating full backups are easy via the concept of "gateway":
	-------------------------------
	*	Multi tentancy: Does not suffer from this single point of
	failure like Solr or RDBMes
	-------------------------------
	


	*	JSON: responses to queries
	are all in JSON and as such
	is very platform agnostic w/r
	to clients
	-------------------------------
	*	Support for all document types: except those that do not
	support text rendering

	note: What is text rendering?
	Text rendering is a method of
	deconstructing text that allows
	the deconstructor to make decisions regarding the importance of the text...that is
	select the portions that are most meaningful to them
	-------------------------------


	Disadvantages:
	*	JSON support only: Unlike Solr that supports CSV,XML,
	and JSON query responses



	Terms
	===============================
	Index ---> DB
	Mapping --> Table
	Field --> Field
	JSON Object ---> Tuple
