Differences between MongoDB
and RDBMS
=====================================

Tables vs Collections
----------------------------------
In a RDMBS, the table
contains the columns and rows
which are used to store
the data whereas, in  MongoDB,
this same structure is known
as a collection. The
collection contains dcoments
which in turn contains
Fileds...which are in turn
are key-value pairs



Rows vs Documents
======================
In RDMBS, the row represents
a single, implicitly  
structured data item in a
table .  In MongoDB, the data
is stored in documents.

Column vs. Fields
===========================
In RDBMS, the column denotes
a set of data values.  These
in MongoDB are known as Fields


Joins vs Embedded Documents
==============================
In RDBMS, data is sometimes spread
across various tables and in
order to show a complete 
view of all data, a join is sometimes
formed across tables to 
get data.  In MongoDB,
all of this data is usually
stored in a single collection,
but seperated by using 
embedded documents....so 
there is no concept of a 
"join" in MongoDB


Data integrity vs...Not 
worrying about data integrity
==========================
For RDBMS...this is a requirment...
for Mongo...not so much

Normalization
======================
Used to prvent orphan
records and duplicates Normalizaing
data then has the requirement 
of more tables, which results
in more table joins, thus requirment
more keys and indexes....
Which...naturally kills
performance.  Mongo doesn't
need normalization
