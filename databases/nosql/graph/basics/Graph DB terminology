Graph DB terminology
=========================================
Vertex
----------------------------------------
Vertex's are abstractions of real world
objects

Edge
------------------------------------------
Edges are abstractions of relationships
between vertices.

What's cool about a graph ?
-------------------------
Relationshps can always be many to many.
There is no need for making extra tables
to manage more complex relationships and not
have the DB turn into an unmanagable mess
due to poor normalization.

Properties
===========================================
On both vertices and edges we can store additional
information, "called properties"


JVCD vertex Properties
========================
status : amazing
charm : infinite
score : 1087569


Summary 
========================================
*	Graph databases don't define tables
*	Graph databaes use vertices to represent real world objects
*	Graph databases use edges to represent relationships
*	Adding new objects and relationships is easy, we simply create
	new vertices and edges



Accessing our graph DB for stuff
===================================================
g.V(4356) //single vertex

g.V().has("name","Jean claude van damme") //matching a property

g.V().has("Year"k,between(1980,1990))
