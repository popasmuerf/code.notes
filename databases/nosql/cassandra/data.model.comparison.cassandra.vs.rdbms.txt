Data Models of Cassandra and RDBMS
===============================================
The following table lists down the points that differentiate
the dta model of Cassandra rom theat of an RDBMS


RDMBS                       Cassandra
=========================   ======================================
*RDMBS deals with           *Cassandra deals with unstructured data 
structured data

*Fixed Schema               *Cassandra has a flexible schema

*A table is an array        *A table is a ist of nested KV pairs
 of arrays(ROW x COLUMN)     (ROW X COLUMN Key x COLUMN VALUE)
 
*Database is the highest    *Tables or column families are the entity
Level of abstraction         of a keyspace

*Tables are the entities    *Tables or column families are the entity
of a database                of a keyspace

*Row is an individual       *Row is a unit of replication in in Cassandra
record in RDBMS

*Columns represents the
attributes of a relation    *column is a unit of storage in Cassandra

*RDBMS supports the         *Relationships are represented using collections
concepts of foriegn
keys, joins
    
    
Why is Cassandra better than your typical RDBMS ?
========================================
Data structures used in Cassandra are more specified
than data structures used in relational databases.
Cassandra data structures are faster than
relational database structures.


Transactions are simple....no complex joins(joins are basically
the traversal of two or more  matrices looking for stuff)


RDBMS have a single point of failure....NSQL DBs don't.
NSQL handles data comming from any location, and comming
in at high velocities.


    
    
Where NOSQL works best
==================================
*Messaging
*IoT
*Product Catalogs and retail apps
*Social Media analytics
*Recomendation engines
