Cassandra -- Architecture
=============================================

*   All the nodes in a cluster play the same role
*   All nodes are both interconnected and independent
    of all other nodes
*   Each node in a cluster can accept read and write requests,
    regardless of where the data is actually located in the cluster
    
*   When a node goes down, read/write requests can be served from other nodes
    in the network.
    
Cassandra components
-------------------------------------------------------
*   Node: It is the place where data is stored
*   Data center: It is a colleciton of realted nodes
*   Commit log: The commit log is a crash-recovery mechanism in Cassandra,
                Every write operation is written to the commit log

    
    
Data Replication in Cassandra
================================================
In Cassandra, one or more of the nodes in a cluster act as 
replicas for a given piece of data.  If it is detected
that some of the nodes reponded with an out-of-data value, 
Cassandra will return the most recent value
to the client.  After returning the most recent value, Cassandra
performs a read repair in the background to update the 
stale values.

Note -- Cassandra used the Gossip Protocol in the background to
allow th enoeds to communicate with each other and etect any
faulty nodes in the cluster.




Cluster
=========================================================
Cassandra database is distributed over several machines that operate
together.  The outermost container is known as the Cluster.
Every node contains a replica, an din case of failure,the replica takes charge.
Cassandra arranges the nodes in a cluster, in a rieng format, an dassigns data to them.



Column families
=============================================================
A column family is a NoSQL object that contains columns of
related data.  It is a tuple(pair) that consists of a 
Key-value pair, where the key is mapped to a value that is a set of 
columns.

Key -----------> col0,col1,col2,col3,col4,...,coln
