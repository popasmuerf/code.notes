The purpose of software tests
========================================
A software test is a piece of software
which executes another piee of software.
It validates if that code resutls in
the expected state(state testing) or
executes the expected sequence of
events (behavior testing)



Why are software tests helpful?
=================================
Software unit tests help the developer to'
verify that the logic of a piece of the 
program is correct.

Running tests automatically helps to identify
software regressions introduced by changes in the source code.  Having  high test coverage of your code
allows you to continue developing features whithout 
having to pedorm lots of manual tests.


Testing frameworks for Java
====================================
There are several testing frameworks
available for Java.  The most popular
ones are JUnit and TestNG



Testing terminology
======================================
1.1     Code or application under test
--------------------------------------
The code which is tested is typically called the 
"code under test".  I fyou are testing an
application, this is called the "application test"

1.2     Test fixture
--------------------------------------
A test fixture is a fixed state in code which
is tested used as input for a test.  Another
way to describe this is a test precondition

For example, a test fixture might be a 
fixed string, which is used as input for a method.
The test would validate if the method
behaves correctly with this input

1.3     Unit tests and unit testing
--------------------------------------
A unit test is a piece of code written by
a developer that executes a specific
functionality in the code to be tested
and asserts a certain behavior or state
