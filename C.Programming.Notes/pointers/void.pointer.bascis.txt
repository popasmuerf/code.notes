Void Pointers in C: Definition
==================================
1. Suppose we have to declare integer pointer,
character pointer and float pointer then
we need to declare 3 pointer values

2. Instead of declaring differnt types of pointer
variable it is feasible to decalre a single pointer
variable which can act as integer, character, pointer.


Void Pointer Basics:
=============================================
1. In C General Purpose Pointer  is called a void pointer
2. It does not have any data type associated with it
3. It can store address of any type of avariable
4. A void pointer is a C convention for a raw address
5. The compiler has no idea what type of object a void pointer really points to.



Delcaration of Void pointer
==================================
void * pointer_name; 


Void Pointer Example:
==================================
void *ptr
char cnum ;
int inum ;
float fnum ;

ptr = &cnum ;
ptr = &inum ;
ptr = &fnum ;
