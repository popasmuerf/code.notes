A Union is a special dta type available in C that enables
you to store different data types in the same memory location.
You can define a union with many members, but only one memeber can contain
a value at any given time.
Unions provide an efficient wy of using the sam memory location for
multi-purpose.


Syntax
===============================
union [union tag]
{
	member definition ;
	member definition;
	.....
	member definition ;

}[one or more union varaibles]



union Data
{
	int i ;
	float f;
	char str[20];

}data ;


So how is a Union different than a struct ?
======================================
A Union IS as struct....save for the fact
that all members of a Union are stored at the
same address.  Members of a union
can ONLY be accessed in a serial manner.

Unions where created for the purpose of 
reducing memory fragmentation.
