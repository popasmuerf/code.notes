1.Law of clarity:
	Users will aoid interface elements
	that have no clear/obvious meaning.
	Question:  Are any of our elements
	bereft of clear and obvious meaning ?

2.Law of prefferred action
	Is the workflow or what the user is supposed to
	do obvious ?  If it isn't....then people
	will be reluctant to use the app.
	Question: Is what one is supposed to do for any part
	of the Workflow more or less obvious ?  Users should
	not have to search for what they want to do:
	Question : Is the main operation
	for some task of some Activity prominent ?

3. Law of Contexts 
Do features make sense within the context they are presented ?
For example....if I want a cup a coffee, it is intuitive
to walk over to the coffee machine, and then press "brew" as 
opposed to walking over to the microwave, or simple just standing
in the kitchen with a bunch of devices that have no outwardly apparent
in function.....or if coffee workflow consists of going downstairs into the laundry room

4. Law of defaults:
	User will rarely change defaults
	Question: Does our app need tons of configuration in order
	to be useful ?

5. Law of guided action:
	The user will likely do what is explicitly asked of them
	by the app:
	Quesion: N/A

6. Law of feedback:
	The user will feel more confident if yo provide clear and constant
	feedback
	Question:""
