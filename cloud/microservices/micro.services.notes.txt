What is a Microservice Archtiecture?
==========================================================
Microservice architecture (MSA) is an approach to building software
systems that decomposes business domain models into smaller,
conssisten, boudned-contexts implemented by services.  These services
are isolated and autonomous yet communicate to procide some piece
of business functionallity.   Microservices are typically implemented
and operated by small teams with enough autonomy that each
team and services can change its internal implementation

Independence breads agility.....kind of....




Microservices allow you to scope the boundaries of a service effectively
========================================================================4
    *   Understand what the service is doing without being tanbled
        into other concerns in a larger application
    *   Quickly build the service locally
    *   Pick the right technology for the problem(lots of writes? lots of
        queries? low latency? bursty?)
    *   Test the service
    *   Build/deploy/release at a cadense necessary for the buisiness,
        which ay be independent of other services
    *   Advantages of autonomous teams and services....
        
        
Things you wont' miss once you  have adopted microservices
======================================================================
    *   Incessant Jira tickets
    *   Unnecessary meetings
    *   Shared libraries
    *   Enterprise-wide canonical models
    
    
Challenges
==========================================================================
    *   Network reliability
    *   Network latency.....
