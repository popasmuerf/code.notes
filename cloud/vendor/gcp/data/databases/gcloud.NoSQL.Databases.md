## NoSQL Databases

*   New approach (actually NOT so new!) to building your databases
    *   NoSQL = not only SQL
    *   Flexible schema
        *   Structure data the way your application needs it
        *   Let the schema evolve with time

    *   Horizaontally scale to petabytes of data with millions of TPS

*   NOT a 100% accurate generalization but a great starting point:
    *   Typical NoSQL databases trade-off "Strong consistency and SQL features" to achieve "scalability and high-performance"

*   Goole Managed Services
    *   Cloud Firestore(Datastore)
    *   Cloud BigTable
