Graphx Programming guide
======================================
GraphX is a new component in Spark for
graphs and graph-parallel computation.
At a high level, GraphX extends the Spark RDD
by introducing a new Graph abastraction:
a directed multigraph and properties attached to
each vertex and edge.  To support graph 
computation, GraphX exposes a set of fundmental
operators:

        *       subgraph
        *       joinVertices
        *       aggregateMessages

as well as an optimized variant of the Pregel
API.  In addition, GraphX includes a growing
collection graph algorithms and builders
to simplify graph analytics tasks



Getting Started
===========================================
import org.apache.spark._
import org.apache.spark.graphx._
import org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD


The property graph
================================================
The property graph is a directed multigraph
with user difined objects attachsharing the ed to each vertex
and edge. A directed multigraph is a directed graph with potentially multiple parrallel edges.

The apbility to support parallel edges simplfies modeling
scenarios where there can be multiple
relationships between vertices:
      __                                       ___
     |v1|  <-------relationship_1------------->|v2| 
     |  |  <-------relationship_2------------->|  |
     ----                                      ----
 


Verticies
==================================================
*       Each vertex is keyed by unique 64-bit
        long identifier
*       GraphX optimizes the representation of vertex and
        edge types when they are primitive data types
        (e.g, int, double, etc...) reducting the in memory
        footprint by storing them in specialized arrays
*       Graphx does not impose any ordering constraints
        on the vertex identifiers.
*       Similaryl, edges have corresponding source
        and destination vertex identifiers
*       The property graph is parameterized over the
        vertex(VD)
           -and-
        edge(ED)


Graphx optimizes the representation of vertex and edge types
when they are primitive data types(e.g.,int,double,etc...) reducing the in memory footprint by storing by 
storing them in specialized arrays


In some cases it may be desirable to have vertices with
different property types in the same
graph.  This can be accomplished through inheritance.
For example, to model users and products
as a bipartite graph we might do the following:

class Graph[VD,ED]{
        val vertices:vertexRDD[VD]
        val edges:EdgeRDD[ED]
}
