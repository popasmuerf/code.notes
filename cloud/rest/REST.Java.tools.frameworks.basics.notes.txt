Services
==================================================================
        *       Java API for RESTful web services(JAX-RS)
                -       Java API for creating RESTful web
                        servcies following the REST
                        architechtural pattern discussed 
                        previously.  JAX-RS is part
                        of the JEE specification.  Jersey
                        Apache CXF, RESTEasy, and Restlet
                        are all JAX-RS reference implementations
                        Note: none of these are limited to theire
                        base reference, such that they all
                        have their own unique features.
        *       There are Java APIs extant on the market
                that are not based on JAX-RS
                        -       RESTX is  a new API
                                targeting server side
                                REST development, while
                                attempting to simplify
                                REST API development.

                        -       Spark(not apache Spark)
                                focuses on server side
                                development and ease of
                                implementation like RESTX

                                with inherent support
                                for building RESTful
                                web servers.
