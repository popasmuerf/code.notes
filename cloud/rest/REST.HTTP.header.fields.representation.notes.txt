Sequence of events
===============================================================
*   client submits a GET request for url http://www.example.com/index.html 
*   Browser establishes a connection with http://www.example.com
*   GET request contains modifiers and client information:

    GET /index.html  HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    Accept: text/htmlAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    Connection: Keep-alive
 
*   Server responds with:

    HTTP/1/1 200 OK
    Accept-Ranges:bytes
    Cache-Control:max-age=604800
    Content-type:text/html
         HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Understanding the HTTP request methods
======================================================================
*   GET
    -   This method is used for retrieve resources from
        the server by using a given URI
*   HEAD
    -   This method is the same as GET request, but it
        only transfers the status line  and header section
        without the response body
*   POST
    -   Posting data to server
*   PUT
    -   Modifies/updates resources pointed at by the URI
*   DELETE
    -   deletes the resource pointed at by the URI
*   TRACE
    -   echos the contents of the recieved request.  Used for debugging   
*   OPTIONS
    -   returns server supported HTTP methods
*   CONNECT
    -   establishes connections to target server over HTTP...debugging ?0
*   PATCH
    -   used for applying partial modifications to a resource
        idnetified by the URI
        
        
        
Representing content types using HTTP header fields
=========================================================================

Request
-----------------------------------------------------
*   Accept
    -   Informs the server what it expects from the
        server's response
        
*   Example:
          Accept: text/htmlAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
    
    
Responses
------------------------------------------------------
*   Content-Type Header
    -   Describes the content type(s)
        that are available to the client.
*   Example:
        Content-Type: text/html
        
        
Cotent Types
=========================================================
*   text
    -   plain text indicates that the content is plain
        text and no speicall software is required to
        read the contents.  The subtype represents more
        specific details about the content, which can
        be used by the client for special processing, if any. 
        Content-Type:text/html indidicates that the body
        contents is html, and the client can use this
        hint to kick off an appropiate rendering engine
        while displaying the response
*   multipart
    -   composed of multiple data types
*   message
    -   type that encapsulates more messages.  It allows
        messages to contain other messges or pointers to
        other messages.  For instance:
            Content-Type/partial
        allows for large messages to be broken up into smaller messages
        The entire message is assembled by the client
*   image
    -   Content-Type: image/png indicates that the body
        content is a *.png image
*   audio
    -   This type indicates the audio data.  For instance,
        Content-Type: audio/mpeg indicates that the body
        content is MP3 or other MPEG audio.
*   video
    -   This type indicates the video data.  For instance,
        Content-Type: video/mp4 indicates that the body conten
        is MP4 video.
*   application
    -   this type represents the application data or
        binary data.  For instance, Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
        designates the content to be in the JS object Notation(JSON) format,
        encoded with UTF-8 character encoding.
