Using Jackson API for processing JSON

Jackson is a multipurpose data processing 
Java library.  The primary capability
of this tool is the support for processing JSON.
It also has addtional modules for processing
the dta encoded in other popular formats such
as:

        *       Apache Avro
                -       Data serialization
        *       Concise Brinary Object Rep.
                -       binary JSON
        *       Smile
                -       binary JSON
        *       XML
        *       CSV
        *       YAML

Jackson's alternative methods for processing JSON:
================================================
        *Tree model APIs:
                -This method provides APIs
                 for building a tree representation
                 of a JSON document
        *Data binding API:
                -This method provides APIs for converting
                 a JSON document into and form Java objects
        *Streaming API:
                -This method provides streaming APIs
                 for reading and writing JSON documents


Grails quick notes on action responses
==========================================
1. redirect:
        *Redirects user to some provided url
2. render:
        *renders view corresponding to the controller
         method/action(or one you provide) with the view
         making use of values within a Map passed to the
         view
3. respond:
         *Looks at the requested content type in the request
          HTTP header and determines what should be returned
          Makes things easier sometimes?
