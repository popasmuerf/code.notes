Description and discovery of
RESTful web servcies
==========================================
As you many know, WSDL is used for
describing the functionality offered 
by a SOAP web service.  This is the
widely accepted standard and is
supported by many enterprises today.


In contract, RESTful web services, there 
is no such standard and you may find
different metadata formats used by 
various enterprises

However, in general, you may see the 
following goals in 
common among all these metadata formats
for RESTful APIs, although they differ
in their syntax and semantics:

        *       Entry points for the service
        *       Resource paths for accessing each resource
        *       HTTP methods allowed to access these
                rescoures, such as:
                        -       GET
                        -       PUT
                        -       DELETE
                        -       POST

        *       Additional parameters that need to be supplied
                with these method, such as pagination parameters,
                while reading large collection
        *       Format types used for representing the request
                and response body contents such as:
                        -       JSON
                        -       XML
                        -       TEXT
        *       Status codes and error messages returned
                by APIs

        *       Human readable documentation for REST APIs,
                which includes the documentation of the 
                request methods, input and output
                parameters, response codes(success or error),
                API security, and business logic
