Sequence of events
===============================================================
*   client submits a GET request for url http://www.example.com/index.html 
*   Browser establishes a connection with http://www.example.com
*   GET request contains modifiers and client information:

    GET /index.html  HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    Accept: text/htmlAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

*   Server responds with:

Understanding the HTTP request methods
======================================================================
*   GET
    -   This method is used for retrieve resources from
        the server by using a given URI
*   HEAD
    -   This method is the same as GET request, but it
        only transfers the status line  and header section
        without the response body
*   POST
    -   Posting data to server
*   PUT
    -   Modifies/updates resources pointed at by the URI
*   DELETE
    -   deletes the resource pointed at by the URI
*   TRACE
    -   echos the contents of the recieved request.  Used for debugging   
*   OPTIONS
    -   returns server supported HTTP methods
*   CONNECT
    -   establishes connections to target server over HTTP...debugging ?0
*   PATCH
    -   used for applying partial modifications to a resource
        idnetified by the URI
        
        
        
Representing content types using HTTP header fields
=========================================================================

Request
-----------------------------------------------------
*   Accept
    -   Informs the server what it expects from the
        server's response
        
*   Example:
          Accept: text/htmlAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
    
    
Responses
------------------------------------------------------
*   Content-Type Header
    -   Describes the content type(s)
        that are available to the client.
*   Example:
        Content-Type: text/html
        
        
Cotent Types
=========================================================
*   text
    -   plain text indicates that the content is plain
        text and no speicall software is required to
        read the contents.  The subtype represents more
        specific details about the content, which can
        be used by the client for special processing, if any. 
        Content-Type:text/html indidicates that the body
        contents is html, and the client can use this
        hint to kick off an appropiate rendering engine
        while displaying the response
*   multipart
    -   composed of multiple data types
*   message
    -   type that encapsulates more messages.  It allows
        messages to contain other messges or pointers to
        other messages.  For instance:
            Content-Type/partial
        allows for large messages to be broken up into smaller messages
        The entire message is assembled by the client
*   image
    -   Content-Type: image/png indicates that the body
        content is a *.png image
*   audio
    -   This type indicates the audio data.  For instance,
        Content-Type: audio/mpeg indicates that the body
        content is MP3 or other MPEG audio.
*   video
    -   This type indicates the video data.  For instance,
        Content-Type: video/mp4 indicates that the body conten
        is MP4 video.
*   application
    -   this type represents the application data or
        binary data.  For instance, Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
        designates the content to be in the JS object Notation(JSON) format,
        encoded with UTF-8 character encoding.

The core architectural elements of 
a RESTful system
==========================================================
Having learned the basics of a RESTful system,
you are now ready to meet the more exciting
concepts of REST.

A uniform interface is fundamental to the architecture
of any RESTful system.  In plain words, this term referes to
a generic interface to manage all interactions etween
a client and a server in a unified way.  All resources (or business data)
involved in the client-server interactions are dealt with
by fixed set of operations.  The following are core elements
that form a uniform interface for a RESTful system:

        *       Resources and their identifiers
        *       Representations of resources
        *       Generic interaction semantics for the REST resources
        *       Self-descriptive messages
        *       Hypermedia as the engine of an application
                state.


Resources
-------------------------------------------------------
A RESTful resource is anything that is addressable over
the Web.  By addressable, we mean resources that can be 
acessed and transferred between clients and servers.
Subsequently, a resource is a logical, temporal mapping to a 
concept in the problem domain for which we are implementing
a solution.

Here are some examples of REST resources:

        *       A news story
        *       The temperature in NY at 4:00 pm EST
        *       a tax return stored in the IRS database
        *       A list of code revision history in a repository
                such as SVN, Git or CVS 
        *       A student in a classroom in a school
        *       A search result for a particular item
                in a Web index, such as Goolge

Even though a resource's mapping is unique, different requests
for resource can return the same underlying binary
represenstation stored in server.  For example, let's say
we have a resource within the context of a publishing system.

then, a request for the latest revision  published and a request
for revision number 12 will at some point in time return the
same representation of the resource.  In this example,
the last revision is Version 12. However, when the latest revision
published is increased to Version 13, a request to the latest
revision will retrun Version 13.  This implies that in a RESTful
architecture, each resource can be accessed directly and indpendently,
and sometimes, different requests may point to the same resource.


HTTP and REST
==========================================================
As we are using HTTP to communiate, we can transfer a
variety of data types between clients and servers
as long as the data type used is supported by HTTP.
For example:
        *       test file from CNN
        *       Flash movie from YouTube
The data is streamed in both cases over TCP/IP
and the browser knows how to interpret the binary streams
beause of the Content-Type header present in the HTTP  response
header.  Following this principle, in a RESTful system
the represnetation of a resource in the response body
depends on the desired Internet media type, which is specified
within the request hader by the client.
