A servlet life cycle can be defined as a the entire process from its
creation  till it's destruction.   The following
are the paths followed by a servlet.

        *       The servelt is initialized by calling the method:
                        -       init()
        *       The sevelt calls the method for processing
                client requests0:
                -       service()
        *       The servlet is terminated by calling the method:
                -       destroy()

        *       After destroy() is called the servlet is
                garbage collected by the jvm   


Servlet Method init():
==============================================================
    *   init() may be called only once per servlet initialization
    *   Servlets are normaly spawned when a user first invokes
        a URL corresponding to the servlet, but yuc an also
        specify that the servlet be loaded when the sever is 
        first started.
    *   Servlets are singletons.  Multiple client requests
        take the form of threads that communicate with the
        Servlet instance
    *   Code example :

        public void init() throws ServletException{
                //initialization code
        }
