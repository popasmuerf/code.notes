Deploying web applications using  Jetty://
=========================================================
Jetty sever instances that configure the deploy module will have a web application deployer
that hot deploys files found in the webaps directory.  Standard WAR files and jetty configuration
files that you place in the webapps directory are hot deployed to the server with the following conventions:

	 *	A directory called app/ is deployed as a standard web appliation if it contains a WEB-INF/ subdirecotry, otherwise
	 	it is deployed as context of static content.  the context path is /app ....that is http://localhost:8080/app
	 	unless the base name is ROOT(case insensitve) , in which case the context path is "/"
	 	If the directory name ends with ".d" it is ignored (but maybe be used by explicit configuration)
	 *	A file called app.war is deplyed as a standard we application with the context path /example
	 	provided that  http:/localhost:8080/example/.  If the base name is ROOT(case sensistive), the context path is /
	 *	An XML file like example.xml is deployed as a context whose configuration is defined by the XML. The configuration 		   itself must set the context path. If example.xml and example.war exist, only the XML is deployed (which may use the  W AR   in its configuration).



Hot deploying a  standard web application, you can hot deploy it into Jetty by copying it into
the directory "webaps"

Jetty Demonstration Web Applications

The demo-base/webapps directory contains the following deployable and auxiliary files:

*ROOT/
	A directory of static content that is deployed to the root context / due to itâ€™s name. Contains the Jetty demo welcome page.
*test.xml
	A context configuration file that configures and deploys test.war. The additional configuration includes the context path as well as setting additional descriptors found in the test.d directory.
*test.war
	The demonstration web application that is configured and deployed by test.xml.
*test.d
	A directory containing additional configuration files used by test.xml to inject extra configuration into test.war.
*async-rest.war
	A web application demonstration of asynchronous REST to eBay, automatically deployed to /async-rest based on the file name.
*test-jaas.war
	A demonstration web application utilizing JAAS for authentication.
*test-jaas.xml
	A context configuration file that configures test-jaas.war. Additional configuration includes setting up the LoginService for authentication and authorization.
*test-jndi.war
	A demonstration web application showing the use of JNDI.
*test-jndi.xml
	A context configuration file that configures test-jndi.war. Additional configuration includes defining objects in the naming space that can be referenced from the webapp.
*test-spec.war
	A demonstration web application that shows the use of annotations, fragments, ServletContainerInitializers and other Servlet Specification 3.0/3.1 features.
*test-spec.xml
	A context configuration file that configures test-spec.war. Additional configuration includes setting up some objects in the naming space that can be referenced by annotations.
*xref-proxy.war
	A demonstration web application that uses a transparent proxy to serve the Jetty src xref from the Eclipse Jetty website.
*example-moved.xml
	A demonstration context configuration file that shows how to use the MovedContextHandler to redirect from one path to another.
