JAX-WS Hello World Example -- RPC Style....
==============================================

JAX-WS is bundled with JDK 1.6, which makes Java web
service development easier to develop.  This
tutorial shows you how to do the following tasks:

1.      Create a SOAP-based RPC style web service
        endpoint by using JAX-WS.
2.      Create a Java web service client manually.
3.      Create a Java web service client via 
        wsimport tool.
4.      Create a Ruby web service client


Lolgz What? : Mkyong says I will be very suprised
how simple it is to develop a RPC style web
service in JAX-WS...challenge accepted Mkyong....
challenge accepted..my man...


Note:
================================================
In general phrases like : "web service endpoint" is a
service which published outside for users to access;
where "web service client" is the party who accesses
the published service.

JAX-WS Web Service End Point
==================================================
The following steps showing how to use
JAX-WS to create a RPC style web service endpoint


1.Create a Web Service Endpoint Interface
-------------------------------------------------
//code for Endpoint Service Endpoint Interface (SEI)
package com.mikeyb.ws ;

import javax.jws.WebMethod ;
import javax.jws.WebService;
import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding ;
import javax.jws.soap.SOAPBinding.Style ;

@WebService
@SOAPBinding(style = Style.RPC)
public interface HelloWorld{
        @WebMethod String getHelloWorldAsString(String name);

2.Create a Endpoint Publisher
-------------------------------------------------
package com.mikeyb.endpoint ;

import javax.xml.ws.Endpoint ;
import com.mkyong.ws.HelloWorldImpl ;

//Endpoint publisher
public class HellWorldPublisher{
        public stgatic void main(String[] args){
                Endpoint.publish("hettp://localhost:9999/ws/hello", new HelloWorld()) ;
        }
}


}

Invoking web services with Java clients
=================================================
The power of web services is ineroperability.  Thanks
to industry collaboration on the web services technologies
        *       SOAP
        *       WSDL
        *       UDDI
and more specificially, thanks to the work of
the Web Services Interoperability organization
(WS-I.org), a web service cna interact with
any other web service, no matter which platofrm
the web service is developed and run on(be it .NET or
IBM WebSphere).





WSDLs describe web services that are registered
to a Universal Description, Discovery and Integration
(UDDI) registery.
====================================================
        *       A web service requester finds
                the web service in the UDDI registry
                and hten bind to the web service, and
                invokes it.

        Service requester <--find---> Service Registry 
        |                               |
        |                               |
        |                              publishes
        |                               |
        |                               |
        |--------binds-------------->Service 
        


Web servies standards for Java
=====================================================
The development of Java technology standards 
occurs through Java Specfication Requests(JSRs)
being submitted to the Java communty Process(JCP)
Two JSRs cover the Java web services architecture:

        1.      JSR 101: Java API for XML based RPC(JAX-RPC)
        2.      JSR 109: Implementing Enterprise Web Services

JAX-RPC
=====================================================
JAX-RPC defines a simple and easy-to-use Java Application
Programming Interface(API) for XML-based Remote Procedure
Calls(RPC) and the Java to XML and XML to Java mapping:

        *       WSDL to java and java to WSDL mappings:
                        -       For example, a WSDL
                                port type is maapped
                                to a Java Service Endpoint
                                Interface(SEI)
        *       XML data type to Java data type and Java
                data type to XML data type mappings,
                including simple types, complext types,
                and arrays

JSR 109
======================================================
JSR 109 specifies the web services programming model
and architechture for the Java 2 Enterprise Edition(J2EE)
enviroment.  JSR 109 builds on SOAp1.1 and WSDL 1.1
to cover the use of JAX-RPC in a J2EE enviroment. 
It also defines a deployment model to J2EE application
servers.  JSR 109's client-side programming model,
which we will cover later.



Service lookup
=======================================================
There are two families of clients, which differ in the 
way the code is written, packaged, and the way they
are invoked:

1.      Unmanaged clients
2.      J2EE cotainer-managed clients


Here, unmanaged means the absense of a JEE container
managed.  Both types are J2SE and are invoked with
a simple java command.  

For unmanaged clients, the service lookup is
through the :

        JAX-RPC ServiceFactory

...a factory for the creation of instances of services
access points.  For J2EE container-managed clients, service
lookup is through JNDI lookup.


ServiceFactory
===============================
JSR-101: "The JAX-RPC ServiceFactory is the standard
way to look up web services in a J2SE enviroment"

https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ws-javaclient/


The JAX-RPC ServiceFactory
===================================
The JAX-RPC ServiceFactory is an abstract
class which acts as a factory for
instantiating JAX-RPC Services.  It is vendor
independent and lets you write portable
code.  TheServiceFactory is instantiated and
used as follows:

        javax.xml.rpc.Service service = ServiceFactory.newInstance().createService(....) ;


^^^  You need to pass the fully qualified name of the
web service, that is...the namespace plus service name,
to the method:

        createService(....) ;

The Steps are as follows:
---------------------------------------
1.      Optionally, specif the WSDL URL
2.      Specify the web service's fully qualified name
3.      Invoke ServiceFactory's createService() method


What do we do with the Service Interface  now ?
==========================================
        *       get a stub/dynamic proxy
                -or-
        *       Dynamic Invokation Interface(DII)

Listing 1 whos how to use the ServiceFactory to 
instantiate a JAX-RPC Service.  QName
is a javax.xml.namespace.QName.


//code:

String wsdlURL = "http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/SOAP_server/ndfdXMLserver.php?wsdl";
String namespace = ""http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/DWMLgen/wsdl/ndfdXML.wsdl"";
String serviceName = "WeatherService" ;
QName serviceQN = new QName(namespace, serviceName) ;
ServiceFactory serviceFactory = ServiceFactory.newInstance() ;
/* The "new URL(wsdlURL)" parameter is optional */
Service service = serviceFactory.createService(new URL(wsdlURL),serviceQN) ;


JNDI service lookup
=================================================
JEE container-managed clients are packaged into Enterprise
Archives (.EAR) files and run from inside a
JEE container.  In addition to the Java code, descriptors
are also packaged into the archive.  Serveral different types
of JEE container-managed clients.

What are QNames ?
======================================
QNames were introduced by XML Namespaces in
order to be used as URI references.  QName
stands for "qualified name" and defines
a vaid identifiter for elements and 
attributes.  QNames are generally
used t referene particular elements or
attributes within XML documents.
