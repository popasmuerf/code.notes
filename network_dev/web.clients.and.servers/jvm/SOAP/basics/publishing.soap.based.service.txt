Architecture of a typical SOAP-based service

Publishing SOAP-Based Web Services with 
a StandAlone Web Server
=============================================
Publishing a @WebService with tomcat or jetty is 
almost the same as publishing a @WebServiceProvider
(@WebServiceProvider is for REST service publishing
when using stand alone web servers)


When publishing using web containers...
we need a few things...
==============================================
        *       web.xml
        *       sun-jaxws.xml

The following web.xml will work for any
implementation annotated as:

        *       @WebService 
                -or-
        *       @WebServiceProvider



<?xml version "1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app>
        <listener>
                <listener-class>
                        com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServletContextListener
                </listener-class>
        </listener>
        <servlet>
                <servlet-name>
                        jaxws
                </servlet-name>
                <servlet-class>
                        com.sun.xml.ws.transport.http.servlet.WSServlet
                </servlet-class>
                <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>                
        </servlet>
        <servlet-mapping>
                <servlet-name>
                        jaxws
                </servlet-name>
                <url-pattern>
                        /*
                </url-pattern>
        </servlet-mapping>

</web-app>


The Metro classes :
------------------------------------------------

        WSServletContextListener

                -and-
        WSServlet 

are in the JAR file
currently names webservices-rt.jar
which can be downloaded with the restof the Metro JARs.


The following jar files are also required(Metro) :
-----------------------------------------------------

        webservices-rt.jar
                -and-
        webservices-api.jar

The jar files in question should be included withing
the src directory so whatever build tool you are using
will include them in the WAR file.


How doe we get the service schema from services
deployed on a standalone server ?
===============================================

> curl http://localhost:8080/myWarFileName?xsd=1



Quick Summary
=======================================
The RandService combines in a single source file:
-------------------------------------------------
        *       Service Endpoint Interface(SEI)
        *       Service Implementation Bean(SIB)

What purposes does the SEI and SIB
serve ?
-------------------------------------
        *       SEI
                -----------------
                High level specification
                that efits an interface,
                service ops
        
        *       SIB
                -----------------
                    -A POJO class such
                     as RandService annotated
                     as @WebService and ecapsulating
                     service operations, each 
                     annotated as @WebMethod

                    -A @Stateless Session EJB that
                     is likewise annotated as
                     a @WebService.  EJBs in general
                     predate JAX-WS; hence, this
                     second type of SIB is an inviting
                     way to expose legacy EJBs as
                     web services

Depending on the implementation....SEI and SIB 
may or may not be implemented within the same class
