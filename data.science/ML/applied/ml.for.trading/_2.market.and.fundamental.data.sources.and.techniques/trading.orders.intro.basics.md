#The Basics of Trading a Stock: Orders


With the proliferation of digital technology and the internet, many
investors are opting to buy and sell stocks for themselves
online instead of paying advisors large commisions to 
execute trades.  However before you can
start buying and selling stocks, it is important tounderstand the
different types of orders and when they are appropiate:




##Key TakeAways...

*   Depending on your investing style; different types of orders 
    can be used to trade stocks more effectively.
    
*   A market order simply buys (or sells) shares at the prevailing
    market prices until the order is filled.
    
*   A limit order specifies a certain price threshold at which the 
    order must be filled, although there is no guarantee that some 
    or all of the order will trade if the limit is set too 
    high or low.
    
*   Stop orders are a kind of market order that are triggered when
    a stock moves above or below a certain level; they are often
    used as a way to insure against larger losses or to 
    lock in profits
    
*   Market and Limit Orders are the two major types of orders that
    every investor should know are the market order and the limit order
    
    
    
##Market Orders

1. Most basic type of trade
2. Order for buying or selling immediately at current price
3. Typically stock buying will be at or near posted ask
4. Typically stock selling will fetch a price at or near posted bid
5. There is no hard guarantee that the traded price is not necessarily
   the p;rice at which the market worder will execute....espeically
   in fast moving and volatile markets such as HFT
   
   
##Limit Orders
1. Sometimes referred to as a pending order, allowing
   investors to buy and sell securities at a certain
   price in the future.
   
2. This type of rder is used to execute a trade if the price 
   reaches the pre-defined level
   
3. The order will not be filled if the proce does not
   reach this set level.
   
4. In effect, a limit order sets the maximum
   or minimum price at which you are willing to 
   buy or sell.
   
5. Example  if you wanted to buy a stock at 10.00, you could
   enter a limit order for this amount.  This means that you not pay one cent over
   $10 for that particular stock.  However, it is still possible
   that you could buy it for less than the 10.00 per share specified
   in the order
   
### The 4 types of Limit Orders
   
1. Buy Limit
    *   An order to purchase a security at or below a specified
        price.  lmit orders must be placed on the correct side
        of the market to ensure they will accomplish the task of 
        improving the price.  For a buy limit order, this means placing
        the order at or below the current market  bid

2. Sell Limit
    *   An order to sell a security at or above a specified
        price.  To ensure an imporoved price, the order must be placed
        at or above the current market ask.

3. Buy Stop:
    *   An order to buy a security at a price above the current
        market bid.  A stop order to buy becomes active only after
        a specified price level has been reached (known as the stop level).
        Buy stop are  are orders placed above the market and sells top.
        orders placed below the market(the opposite of buy and sell limit
        orders, respectivel).  Once a stop level has been reached,
        the order will be immediatel converted into a market or limit order.
    

4. Sell Stop
