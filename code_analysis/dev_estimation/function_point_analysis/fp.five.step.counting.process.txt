The benefits of Function Point Analysis
==============================================
*	The ability to accurately estimate:
		-	project cost
		-	project duration
		-	project staffing size 

*	An understanding of other important metrics, such as:
		-	Project defect rate
		-	Cost per FP
		-	The productivity benefits of using new or different tools



A simple five step counting process
=========================================
A high-level review of a five step process of counting FPs:

*	Determine the type of count
*	Identify the scope and boundary of the count
*	Determine the unadjusted FP count
*	Determine the Value Adjustment Factor
*	Calculate the Adjusted FP count



Five standard "functions"
==========================================
In counting FPs there are five standard "functions" that you will count.
the first two of these are called "Data Functions", and last three
are called Transactions Functions.  the names of these functions are
listd below:

1. Data Functions
	*	Interal logical files
	*	External interface files
2. Transactional Functions
	*	External Inputs
	*	External Inputs
	*	Exteranl Inquiries


Using the terminology above...when a person that counts FPs looks at a software
system, they see something like the following:

EIs									
EOs	----------------------> Application being counted  ------->Feeds(EOs,EQs)
EQs								(ILFs)                 |
									|				   |------>Reports(EOs,EQs)
									|				   |------>Other Outputs(EOs,EQs)
									|
									|
									|
									|
Data Feeds from other apps(EI)----->|

Details on the five Data and Transactional functions....
=========================================================
This section provides more detailed information and definitions on the five Data
and Transactional Functions.  Before we start getting into the meat of the situation...
there are some terms that you need to understand.

Important terms and definitons used in describing the five functions
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	*User identifiable:
		-This term refers to defined requirements for processes and/or groups of data that
		 are agreed upon and understood y, both the users and ostware developers.
	*Control information:
		-This data that infulences and elementary proces of the application being counted.
		 It specifies what, when, or how data is to be processed
	*Elementary process:
		-An elementary process is the smallest unit of activity that is meaningful to the user
		 An elementary process must be self-contained and leave the business of the
		 application being counted in a consistent state.
	*Data Element Type, or DET
		-A data element type is unique, user recognizable, non-repeated field.  This defintion
		 applies to both analyses of data functions and transactional functions.
	*Record Element Type, or RET
		-A record element type is a user recognizeable subgroup of data data elements within
		 an Internal Logical file or External Interfact File
