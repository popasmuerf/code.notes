Fragment Communication:
========================================
Because the fragment manager knows about all fragments
attached to the current activity, the activity or any frament in that activity can
ask for any other framgent using :
	getter methods
but this is not ideal.  This would cause your fragments
to know much more about other activity framents tha they should.
This leads to an unhealthy amount of coupling which should be avoided.
As always, interfaces are the ideal method for object communication
in OOP languages.

Note about the effiency of using 
interfaces over the FragmenterManager
for intra fragment communication:
+++++++++++++++++++++++
It is cleaner, and generally scales better
than using the FragmentManager...take this
into account when conscidering mobile power
consumption and resources


Example of Direct Frame-to-Frame 
Communication using the FragmentManager
===========================================
FragmentOther  fragOther = (FramentOther)getFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag("other");
fragOther.callCustomMethod(arg1,arg2);
