Note on Rotation of device in emulator:
========================================
Alt-F11

Persistence of Fragments
=====================================
During rotation, if you pay attention to LogCat
messages(needs to be set on info level logging)
You will notice that with every rotation,
the activity is being destroyed and then recreated.
LogCat displays in real-time the life-cycle of your
Activity and Fragments

Fragment state persistance
=====================================
Android saves automatically:
	Data you placed in the Bundle instance
	passed to your Activity onCreate and onSaveInstance
	activity callback methods.
		-and-
	Knowledge of the type of fragment you are using.

newInstance() method
=====================================
While recreating a fragment, Android
WILL NOT call newInstance again as opposed 
to using the default constructor, attaching the arguments
bundle to it, and then  starts calling the callbacks on
the fragment.

You should not do anything fancy  in the 
	newInstance()
method.
